The carbonate front is relatively close to today's deep regional water table and is close in depth to the pyrite reaction front under the ridge, where it is hard to ascertain exact depths. The pyrite reaction front is deeper than today's water table under the valley, as shown. Above each reaction front, the mineral of interest becomes depleted. The upper layer of soil and highly fractured rock shown in gray allows lateral subsurface flow (also referred to here as interflow) of water. Most of the water that infiltrates at the land surface flows along this pathway or is lost to evapotranspiration, leaving relatively little water recharging the deep groundwater.

However, unlike Renzetti et al. (1992), who identified the predominant subsurface flow path as being along the bedrock-soil interface, our results indicate that subsurface runoff pathways are strongly influenced by the underlying bedrock microtopography and the predominant subsurface flow path may occur through surface organic LFH soils rather than through deeper mineral soils. The hydrographic analysis of the linked subbasin runoff response provides an indication of the complexity of interactions between the hydrological contributing area and flow pathways that occur within this landscape. Under dry antecedent conditions the initial runoff will be generated as Horton overland flow from lichen-covered bedrock surfaces. Runoff from forest areas will begin later in the event, first as subsurface stormflow and, if the event is large enough, as saturation overland flow. Under wet antecedent conditions the time lag is reduced and the hydrological contributing areas expand rapidly to include forested areas and lichen-bedrock areas draining into the soil deposits. Peak runoff from this landscape occurs when forest soil deposits become saturated, maximizing the potential hydrological contributing area. Runoff during the recession limb of the storm hydrograph occurs almost entirely as subsurface stormflow from forested areas over a prolonged time period. The temporal changes in both runoff pathway and hydrological contributing area and the proportion of pre-event water associated with each hydrological pathway will result in temporal variations in runoff water quality in this landscape (Allan et al., submitted). Exposed lichen-covered granitic surfaces comprise most of the surface area within each of the catchments examined. This results in most of the runoff being generated as Horton overland flow. However, the occurrence of the forest soil deposits in bedrock depressions results in the routing of a considerable portion of the runoff generated as Horton overland flow through the forest soil deposits as subsurface stormflow and subsequently as return flow. Therefore, the potential modification of precipitation chemistry by the isolated forest stands in this landscape is considerable. The forested soil deposits also serve to delay and reduce runoff from these systems by storing runoff from upslope bedrock areas. The prolonged drainage from forest soils after rain and snowmelt periods, although quantitatively minor, is important to the maintenance of the vegetative community established on the dry granitic outcrops.

The 13 ha WS18 watershed was last selectively harvested in the early 1920s prior to the establishment of the CHL (Douglass and Hoover, 1988). Although the watershed has not been actively managed for more than 80 years, there have been several natural disturbances that have altered forest structure and species composition, including Chestnut blight fungus (Endothia parasitica) in the 1920s1930s, drought in the 1980s and 2000s, Hurricane Opal in 1995, and hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) defoliation from 2002 to the present (Boring et al., 2014). Precipitation in WS18 averages 2010 mm/year; it is highest in the late winter months and lowest in the autumn, although a disproportionate amount of large events associated with tropical storms occurs during this season. Less than 10% of precipitation occurs as snow. The variability in precipitation has been increasing over time resulting in more frequent extremely wet years and extremely dry years, while annual average air temperature has been increasing by 0.5°C/decade since 1981 (Laseter et al., 2012). Annual precipitation in WS18 is approximately equally partitioned into streamflow (49.6%) and evapotranspiration (50.4%). During the growing season, transpiration accounts for 55% of total evapotranspiration with evaporation from canopy interception making up the balance, approximately 15% of precipitation (Ford et al., 2011). Streamflow is typically highest in MarchApril and lowest in SeptemberOctober but never ceases, even during extreme drought. Seasonal patterns in streamflow reflect the combined effects of the seasonality in precipitation and evapotranspiration (Fig. 14.2). Baseflows are relatively high, producing the third largest Q90/Q50 ratio among sites (Table 14.2). Baseflows are sustained by lateral movement of water through deep unsaturated soil (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume), driven by large hydraulic gradients induced by steep slopes (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1963). On average, approximately 5% of annual precipitation (9% of annual streamflow) is discharged as stormflow (Swift et al., 1988). Stormflow originates primarily from small portions of the watershed located adjacent to the stream in coves and in riparian zones where the water table may be near the surface (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967). Shallow lateral subsurface discharge from upslope landscape positions to streams can also contribute to stormflow where large soil macropores exist. Overland flow is extremely rare or non-existent because of the presence of well-developed forest floors and subsurface macropores.";14.2.3;Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CHL), reference watershed WS18, North Carolina;227;Coweeta, North Carolina, United States;35,059984000000000;-83,427240999999995;0,610000000000000;1;N;1;N;Vegetation described;N;N;Slopes described;N;N;N;2,000000000000000;Riparian aquifer storage, Water Table;Chan.Store.Rip, Sub.GW.Store.Wtable;9,000000000000000;Lateral macropore flow, Gaining stream, Topographic convergence, Quickflow, Channel flow, Lateral unsaturated flow, Canopy Interception, Transpiration, Evapotranspiration;Sub.SSFlow.Macro, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.SSFlow.Conv, Chan.Flow.Quick, Chan.Flow, Sub.Soil.Lat, Surf.Int.Int.Canopy, Surf.ET.Transp, Surf.ET;1,000000000000000;N/A

The 39 ha WS4 watershed is forested with an approximately 100-year-old stand of mixed deciduous hardwoods. The bedrock is acidic sandstone and shale. Depth to bedrock is generally less than 1 m and the topography is steep. Precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year and averages 1458 mm. Although snow is common in winter, snowpack generally lasts no more than a few weeks; snow contributes approximately 14% on average of precipitation (Adams et al., 1994). Large rainfall events can occur during extra-tropical hurricanes in the summer and autumn, but about half of the largest storms have occurred during the dormant season (1 November30 April), when streams are most responsive to rainfall because evapotranspiration losses are low (Fig. 14.2). The stream channel is intermittent near the top of the watershed. Streamflow may cease during the late summer and early autumn (about 10% of daily flows), in response to high evapotranspirative demand and low precipitation. Although baseflow contributes relatively little to Q90/Q50 (Table 14.2), it dominates stream discharge in WS4. Most discharge occurs during the dormant season (Fig. 14.2) due to greater precipitation and decreased evapotranspirative demand from deciduous forests. Baseflow is sustained by lateral subsurface flow to channels; DeWalle et al. (1997) characterized the mean transit time for baseflow on WS4 as 1.41.6 years, which suggests a dominance of slow movement through the soil matrix. The water balance on WS4 was well quantified by Patric (1973) with runoff accounting for about 40% of precipitation, 27% of the balance being lost through transpiration and about 16% to canopy evaporation. Seasonal differences in losses from canopy interception due to leaf development and leaf drop were detected. Stormflow discharge is fairly flashy (Plates 11 and 12), with the storm hydrograph responding rapidly to storm precipitation inputs and then returning quickly to baseflow conditions, and streamflow generation occurs via saturation excess flow. Stormflow discharge typically occurs less than 15% of the time. There is little to no infiltration-excess overland flow even during the largest storms because of the high infiltration capacity of an intact forest floor.";14.2.4;Fernow Experimental Forest (FnEF), reference watershed WS4, West Virginia;228;Fernow, West Virginia, United States;39,053972999999999;-79,687043000000003;0,387000000000000;1;N;3;Season;Vegetation described;Soil described;Geological types described;Slopes described;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Soil water storage, Channel storage, Snow storage;Sub.Soil.Store, Chan.Store, Surf.Snow.Stor;8,000000000000000;Gaining stream, Canopy evaporation, Evapotranspiration, Saturation excess flow, Quickflow, Lateral matrix flow, Intermittent streamflow, Transpiration;Sub.GWSW.Gain, Surf.ET.Evap.Canopy, Surf.ET, Surf.Over.SE, Chan.Flow.Quick, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix, Chan.Flow.Interm, Surf.ET.Transp;1,000000000000000;N/A

Vegetation at W3 is composed mainly of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). The 42 ha watershed is mostly second growth and much of the HBEF was harvested in the 1910s (Table 14.1). Additional salvage harvesting occurred at the HBEF following the Great New England Hurricane of 1938. More recently, trees incurred some damage during the North American Ice Storm of 1998, with no apparent impact on annual runoff. The climate at the HBEF is cool and humid. On average, W3 receives 1350 mm of precipitation annually, which is distributed evenly throughout the year. Precipitation has increased by 25% during the record period, which is consistent with broader regional trends (Brown et al., 2010). Approximately one-third of precipitation falls as snow (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume) and a snowpack generally persists from late December until mid-April. Soil frost forms during winter two out of every three years with an average annual maximum depth of 6 cm. The annual hydrograph shows a strong seasonal pattern with a peak during snowmelt runoff. Despite the higher flow during spring, floods can occur at any time of year when soil water deficits are reduced (Fig. 14.2). An increasing trend in precipitation has resulted in increasing trends in the magnitude of both low and high streamflows (Campbell et al., 2011). Approximately 64% of the precipitation that falls on the watershed becomes streamflow, with evapotranspiration comprising the remainder. Slight, but statistically significant declines in evapotranspiration have occurred in W3 (14% over 56 years) for reasons that are unknown. This decline appears to be due to local influences since similar trends are not consistently found at a larger regional scale. The relatively steep FCD for W3 (Plates 11 and 12) has traditionally been attributed to coarse, well-drained soils and mountainous topography that produce a flashy runoff response. Overland flow is also minimal because of the high infiltration capacity of the forest floor. In recent years, a more complete understanding of complex flow generation processes at the site has emerged. Data from a network of wells in W3 have revealed an intermittent, discontinuous water table (Detty and McGuire, 2010a; Gannon et al., 2014; Gillin et al., 2015). Stormflow generation is the result of lateral subsurface flow in the solum. Under some soil moisture conditions, small changes in groundwater can produce large changes in runoff, suggesting a threshold response that is related to flowpaths and soil transmissivity (Detty and McGuire, 2010b; Gannon et al., 2014). During low flows, only the near-stream zone is consistently hydrologically connected to the stream network. As the watershed wets up, more distal, previously isolated portions of the water table become hydrologically connected.";14.2.7;Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), reference watershed W3, New Hampshire;229;Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire, United States;43,954602000000001;-71,722581000000005;0,424000000000000;1;N;1;N;Vegetation described;N;N;Slopes described;N;N;N;5,000000000000000;Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Soil water storage, Perched water tables, Riparian aquifer storage, Snow storage;Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Chan.Store.Rip, Surf.Snow.Stor;8,000000000000000;Connectivity between hillslopes and channel, Channel flow, Infiltration, Lateral matrix flow, Snowmelt, Evapotranspiration, Subsurface stormflow, Quickflow;Sub.GWSW.Conn.Hill, Chan.Flow, Surf.Inf.Inf, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix, Surf.Snow.Melt, Surf.ET, Sub.SSFlow, Chan.Flow.Quick;1,000000000000000;N/A

The landscape includes uplands, peatlands, lakes and streams. Unlike mountainous research watersheds, streamflow typically is not bedrock controlled in the western lakes section where outwash sands, some >50 m deep, form large aquifers (Verry et al., 2011).  Aquiferpeatland connectivity varies between two peatland types: bogs and fens (Bay, 1967). In watersheds with either type, streamflow may originate from precipitation and flow along near-surface and shallow surface flowpaths in upland mineral soils (Verry et al., 2011). Bog watersheds may be perched due to loamy clay tills that retard the vertical flow of water from soils to the outwash aquifer (Verry et al., 2011). In fen watersheds, most streamflow, which may exceed streamflow from bogs by orders of magnitude during low flow, originates as discharge from aquifers and is perennial (Bay, 1967). The 10 ha S2 study watershed, with a bog (33% of the area), has low topographic relief (Table 14.1) with upland mineral soils that drain through peatland margins to an intermittent stream. Eleven to 33% of annual precipitation (456981 mm) occurs as streamflow and 517% recharges the underlying aquifer (Nichols and Verry, 2001) (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Calculated evapotranspiration (precipitation  streamflow  recharge) has been 372605 mm/year. Nine of the ten highest daily streamflows have occurred during rainfallrunoff events, not snowmelt or rain-on-snow events. Periods of no streamflow occur during any month and there has been no flow during 38% of the record (Plates 11 and 12), consistent with the zero value of Q90/Q50 (Table 14.2). Although most of the S2 area is uplands, most of the annual water budget (58%) comes from direct precipitation on the peatland (Verry et al., 2011). If the water table is >510 cm below the peatland surface, streamflow ceases and that storage must be replenished before resumption. Rainfall amount during summer exceeds snow water equivalents during winter and stormflows recess rapidly to no flow due to evapotranspiration. Melt from snow accumulation (November/December to March/April) results in several weeks of high flows (Sebestyen et al., 2011) (Fig. 14.2). Winter and spring frost in upland soils, exceeding 50 cm, prevents infiltration (Verry et al., 2011). Snowmelt waters flow overland until soils thaw in the spring, after which flow mostly occurs in the shallow subsurface through sandy loams above loamy clay horizons (Verry et al., 2011). Subsurface flow may persist for weeks until the upland deciduous forest begins transpiring. During large summer rainfall events, subsurface flow may last for several hours, but rarely longer.;14.2.8;Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), reference watershed S2, Minnesota;230;Marcell, Minesota, United States;47,515405410876902;-93,471817980987197;0,097000000000000;1;N;1;N;Vegetation described;Soil described;N;Slopes described;N;N;N;8,000000000000000;Groundwater storage, Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Perched water tables, Soil stratification, Soil water storage, Water Table, Soil saturation, Snow storage;Sub.GW.Store, Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Sub.Soil.Store.Layer, Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Wtable, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Surf.Snow.Stor;10,000000000000000;Perennial flow, Transpiration, Quickflow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Connectivity, Subsurface stormflow, IE flow from frozen ground, Evapotranspiration, Snowmelt, Intermittent streamflow;Chan.Flow.Peren, Surf.ET.Transp, Chan.Flow.Quick, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.GWSW.Conn, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.Over.IE.Frozen, Surf.ET, Surf.Snow.Melt, Chan.Flow.Interm;1,000000000000000;N/A

The 155 ha WS80 watershed is covered with a pine/mixed hardwood forest (Table 14.1), which has been undisturbed by management activities since 1936, but was heavily affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 that damaged >80% of the forest canopy (Hook et al., 1991).Seasonally, the winter is generally wet with low-intensity, long-duration rain events and rare snowfall. Summer is characterized by short-duration, high-intensity storm events and tropical depression storms are common. The seasonal runoff response to rain events is shown in Fig. 14.2. Approximately 22%, on average, of annual precipitation becomes runoff (Amatya et al., 2006), resulting in about 78%  evapotranspiration, assuming negligible seepage (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Approximately 60% of the runoff is contributed by shallow surface or runoff/rainwater, the rest by subsurface flow (Epps et al., 2013). Based on the FDC analysis this watershed produces flow only 56.3% of the time and hence has a zero value of Q90/Q50 (Plates 11 and 12, Table 14.2). The principal flow generation mechanism is driven by the shallow water table (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume) (Harder et al., 2007; Epps et al., 2013), controlled primarily by rainfall and evapotranspiration, and minimally by deeper groundwater underlain by Santee Limestone approximately 20 m below the ground surface. The formation of an argillic horizon with poorly drained clayey subsoil provides a dynamic shallow groundwater table that has a complex non-linear relationship with streamflow (Harder et al., 2007). Saturation-excess surface and shallow subsurface runoff with rapid lateral transfers within the highly permeable upper soil layer may occur along reaches with flat topography. Surface depressional storage was shown to affect the surface runoff rate (Amoah et al., 2012). Runoff and peak flow at this watershed are dependent on both rainfall amount and intensity, as well as antecedent conditions reflected by initial water table positions (Epps et al., 2013). A key observation from WS80 is the reversal of the flow relationship between this and the treatment watershed, compared with the earlier calibration period, for a decade beginning three years after Hurricane Hugo severely damaged vegetation on both watersheds.

As the soil wetness increases, there is an increase in the connections in the preferential flow network, causing faster subsurface velocities and increasing the area of hillslope contributing to runoff (Tsuboyama et al., 1994; Sidle et al., 2000; Uchida et al.,2005; Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell, 2006b). These excavations support this conceptual model. We observed that the preferential flow paths were connected by matrix flow through mineral and organic soils. In some areas, this saturated flow was perched above soil with low hydraulic conductivity and spread out horizontally in the overlying layers of more conductive soils. In other areas the flow had verti-
cal components because the water was flowing downward to areas with higher conductivities. These observations showed that a connection may be established by increased soil wetness within a small localized area. The subsurface flow in this hillslope is highly dynamic and depends on the precipitation characteristics and antecedent condition. Trenched hillslopes from around the world have identified differences in subsurface flow characteristics based on the subsurface topography and the saturated zone connections of the hillslope and the trench (e.g. Tani, 1997; Hutchinson and Moore, 2000; Freer et al., 2002; Tromp van Meerveld and McDonnell, 2006a). The excavations presented here show that trenches with large contributing areas collect flow from preferential flow networks that are efficient at transferring water, due in part to a high degree of hydraulic connectivity. The soils in these areas could transport water one order of magnitude faster than other soils (Anderson et al., 2009). The dye staining also revealed that there is often little interaction between water in the preferential flow path and the surrounding soil matrix unless there was a constriction in the preferential flow network.";4.2;Conceptual models of runoff;942;Russell Creek Research Watershed, Vancouver Island, Canada;50,328172740534399;-126,385379852192997;32,000000000000000;1;N;1;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;1,000000000000000;Soil water storage;Sub.Soil.Store;5,000000000000000;Lateral matrix flow, Lateral matrix flow at soil horizons, Vertical matrix flow, Organic layer interflow, Lateral macropore flow;Sub.SSFlow.Matrix, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix.Horiz, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.SSFlow.Organ, Sub.SSFlow.Macro;1,000000000000000;N/A

Because overland flow was minimal, rapid flow through a macroporous medium was inferred, that may include macropores (Beven and Germann, 1982), cracks in the soil (McDonnell, 1990), or soil layers of differing hydraulic conductivity (Chappell et al., 1990; McDonnell et al., 1991). This inference is supported by the sound of water flowing during precipitation events immediately under the organic-covered rocky overburden common throughout the Catskills (P. Murdoch, personal communication). The inability of throughfall on the saturated channel area to fully account for the event-water contributions estimated from the two-component isotopic separation suggests a contribution from a source other than throughfall, but with an isotopic signature similar to throughfall. Only the water collected from the O-horizon had a ´18O composition heavy enough to explain the isotopic response in stormflow. [...] The O-horizon component is postulated to occur as lateral flow above the mineral soil surface as described by McDonnell et al. (1991). The high contrast in hydraulic conductivity between the porous organic material and the mineral horizon promotes lateral flow during precipitation events (Chappell et al., 1990). Water content in the upper soil profile increased and decreased more rapidly and to a greater extent than the water content in the deeper soil in response to rain events, supporting the shallow lateral-flow hypothesis. The shallow soil water, however, may have drained either in a lateral direction toward the stream channel or in a vertical direction deeper in the soil. But water from the upper soil layer that was distinct from deeper soil water accounted for the response of DOC concentrations and ´18O in stormflow, suggesting the importance of lateral flow to the stream from the upper soil layer. Bypass flow to bedrock is inferred from the rapid response of the water table on the hillslope relative to the delayed response of water content in the mineral soil immediately above the water table. Groundwater levels, however, did not increase sufficiently to reach the organic horizon (increasing only 0.050.3 m in the 11.5 m soil) as might be expected in a transmissivity feedback process (Bishop et al., 1990). Furthermore, the bedrock surface at which the water table develops is effectively horizontal, decreasing the likelihood of subsurface flow induced by the topography of the bedrock surface as observed by McDonnell et al. (1996).";5.2;Evidence of a rapid shallow subsurface flow component;186;Shelter Creek, New York, United States;41,970108000000003;-74,514415000000000;1,610000000000000;1;N;1;N;N;Soil hydraulic properties described;N;N;N;N;N;2,000000000000000;Channel storage, Water Table;Chan.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Wtable;4,000000000000000;Throughfall, Overland Flow, Infiltration into bedrock via preferential flow paths, Organic layer interflow;Surf.Int.Thru, Surf.Over, Sub.GW.BedInf.Macro, Sub.SSFlow.Organ;1,000000000000000;N/A

However, the fact that the runoff ratio declined from 0.43 for Storm 1 to 0.12 for Storm 2, despite Storm 2 having three times the rainfall of Storm 1, indicates a strong soil water and/or frost control on the total volume of lateral water movement. The small surface-saturated area of the catchment cannot explain event water contributions of ca 8% indicated by hydrograph separations. Well data show that the water tables reside in near-surface organic layers, especially at lower slope locations, indicating that rapid flow within the organic layer provides water for streamflow by nature of its higher hydraulic conductivity (Figure 2), allowing some event water (possibly through preferential or bypass flow) to reach the stream with little mixing. Both two- and tree-component separations indicate an overwhelming portion of stormflow water exists within the catchment prior to the event. Three-component hydrograph separations show that flow through the mineral substrate, not the organic layer, dominates stormflow response. Whether significant mixing between mineral- and organic-layer water occurs during storms, thus reducing the apparent organic flow contributions, is unclear. The hydrological and hydrochemical interaction between the riparian zone and the hillslope is an area of considerable uncertainty, and the extent to which the riparian zone modifies hillslope DOC and water chemistry is potentially large. McGlynn and McDonnell (2003) found no evidence that riparian zones exhibit DOC flushing in a temperate catchment, and that the temporally dynamic mixing of spatial sources of runoff controlled the observed patterns of runoff at both the slope and small catchment scale. The near-surface position of the phreatic surface controls the larger volumes of runoff observed in Storm 1, as the concept of transmissivity feedback (Bishop, 1991) applies to organic-covered permafrost slopes (Quinton et al., 2000). As summer progresses and water tables fall deeper within the porous organic soil, more precipitation must be applied to raise water tables and increase runoff rates and ratios. The descent of the frost table on permafrost-underlain slopes moderates water table positions, encouraging enhanced drainage compared with permafrost-free slopes (Carey and Woo, 2001a). On the permafrost-free Sf-slope, the water table was significantly lower at upslope locations, indicating reduced runoff, yet remained near the surface in riparian zones. Using hydrochemical and isotopic methods, it was not possible to distinguish between slopes with seasonal frost and permafrost.;N/A;Summer runoff mechanisms;111;Granger Basin, Wolf Creek, Yukon, Canada;60,551197000000002;-135,197751000000011;6,000000000000000;4;Process;2;Season;N;N;N;N;N;Uncertainty described;N;3,000000000000000;Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Soil saturation, Water table fall;Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Sub.GW.Store.Fall;4,000000000000000;Subsurface stormflow, Lateral macropore flow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Organic layer interflow;Sub.SSFlow, Sub.SSFlow.Macro, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.SSFlow.Organ;1,000000000000000;N/A

";N/A;N/A;N/A;Although no preferential flow was observed, results from this study using stable isotope and simple hydrochemical indicators support these observations and highlight the increased importance of temporary storage at the onset of melt. At the beginning of the melt period, meltwater percolating from the snowpack infiltrates the frozen ground, which is typically unsaturated. On slopes with permafrost soils and an organic cover, infiltration is restricted to the porous organic soils whereas, on slopes with seasonal frost, percolation is uninhibited unless there are ice-rich layers at depth (Kane and Stein 1983). The isotopic signature of liquid soil water at this time becomes strongly depleted with respect to d18O suggesting large meltwater recharge (Figure 4). Additionally, soil temperatures are ca. 08C, as meltwater infiltrating the soil provides little sensible heat to melt pore water, thus reducing the mixing of melt and pre-melt pore water until soil thaw begins. During these early melt stages, there is little lateral transfer of water to the stream until the unsaturated storage capacity of the soils declines and soil thaw allows runoff pathways to become exposed. Once snow-free areas increase and a perched water table is formed, runoff is rapidly conveyed to the stream from permafrost-underlain slopes with a strong meltwater isotope signature (Figure 4). Hydrochemically, DOC that is removed from organic soils in the meltwater solution is flushed during this initial runoff pulse (Carey 2003). The decline in streamflow SpC occurs following the initial DOC and d18 O depletion signal from the initial storage release, as meltwater is then allowed to pass rapidly from the melting snowpack to the stream via the organic layer, bypassing the significant interaction with underlying mineral soils. The fraction of meltwater contributing to streamflow declines, however, as pore water within the organic layer melts, mixing with and being displaced by meltwater. During peak freshet, the continued dominance of flow through the organic layer is supported by the decline in stream Spc and pH, the latter occuring due to acidification from organic-layer water. Near the end of the freshet period, meltwater infiltration continues, yet mixing with subsurface soils, including those from the mineral layer, dilutes the melt d18O signature and displaces pre-melt stored water. As the freshet period ends, thaw allows interaction with the mineral soils as evidenced by the increase in stream SpC and pH whereas DOC has declined to near pre-freshet levels.;N/A;Snowmelt runoff mechanism;321;Granger Basin, Wolf Creek, Yukon, Canada;60,551197000000002;-135,197751000000011;6,000000000000000;1;N;5;Season with snow;N;Soil types described;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Permafrost storage, Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Perched water tables;Surf.Frozen.Perm, Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.GW.Store.Perch;7,000000000000000;Snowmelt, Infiltration, Organic layer interflow, Infiltration into snowpack, Mixing, Lateral macropore flow at soil horizons, Infiltration into frozen ground;Surf.Snow.Melt, Surf.Inf.Inf, Sub.SSFlow.Organ, Surf.Snow.Inf, Sub.Soil.Mix, Sub.SSFlow.Macro.Horiz, Surf.Frozen.Inf;1,000000000000000;N/A

Typical podzols, which had the highest response thresholds, dominated the catchment, accounting for an estimated 50% of the catchment area [Gillin, 2013] and primarily occurred along midslope positions. While E and Bhs podzols almost always occurred together on the landscape, they were also almost always separated from hillslope Bh podzols by typical podzols (Figure 2). Hillslope and near-stream Bh podzols were likewise sometimes separated from each other by typical podzols. This paints a picture of stormflow generation via a spatial patchwork of water table occurrence within the solum, and therefore lateral subsurface flow in the solum of the catchment, rather than an uninterrupted saturated area extending up from streams. A system such as this highlights the importance of the active versus contributing areas of Ambroise [2004]. For example, water tables occurred in E and Bhs podzols far from the stream at frequently exceeded thresholds of catchment storage necessary for water table occurrence. Furthermore, there are large areas of the catchment separating E and Bhs podzols from the stream that only had water tables in the solum during extreme events (typical podzols). While portions of E and Bhs podzol areas may connect with intermittent or ephemeral channels, in many cases water tables occur upslope and infiltrate to deeper storage before the areas of saturation reach a stream channel. When water from these soils does enter stream channels, it often flows into portions of the stream network where the stream is surrounded by typical podzols, likely indicating the stream is losing water to surrounding soils. During larger events, when thresholds are exceeded in typical podzols, E and Bhs podzols are more likely to connect to the stream (Figure 1). Therefore, if water tables connected to the stream channel generate stormflow, there are active areas in the catchment that are not contributing areas unless a high threshold of catchment storage is exceeded. However, water in these areas is moving further downward into the C horizon. Water in the C horizon may take one of several paths to the stream network. While generally lower conductivity [Detty and McGuire, 2010b], the C horizon in WS3 has been shown to be heterogeneous, with lenses of higher conductivity material [Bailey et al., 2014]. Furthermore, preliminary ground penetrating radar results have shown the C horizon to be 09 m thick. Therefore, most water entering the C horizon will take a slower flow path to the stream, recharging the larger C horizon groundwater reservoir. However, as high conductivity areas of till are present throughout the catchment, there also exists the possibility of groundwater following such a pathway to the stream. Some water moving from water tables in E and Bhs podzols into the C horizon may contribute flow to streams in this way. Other authors have discussed discontinuous active areas on hillslopes [McNamara et al., 2005; Spence, 2010; Stieglitz et al., 2003]. Furthermore, as distance from the stream increases, some authors have found a decreased correlation of groundwater levels with streamflow [Haught and van Meerveld, 2011; Penna et al., 2014; Seibert et al., 2003]. The spatial patchwork of solum water table occurrence in WS3 is consistent with the behavior presented in these other studies. However, we have identified an integrative characteristic (i.e., hydropedological unit) that is consistently indicative of water table behavior. Looking at the catchment through this lens provides a framework for mapping continuous/discontinuous water table occurrence in the solum of the catchment through time. As mentioned above, the role of discontinuous water tables in generating streamflow is currently unknown, as is their potential influence on stream chemistry. However, the insights offered in this study may provide an approach to more closely investigate the effects of patchy regions of subsurface saturation located throughout a catchment. In addition to being a useful tool for examining the role of discontinuous solum water tables, our findings may be useful for examining the evolution of contributing area throughout events. Our observations are consistent with others suggesting distinct hydrologic regimes in near-stream areas [Cirmo and McDonnell, 1997; McGlynn and Seibert, 2003; Ocampo et al., 2006]. We detected persistent water tables in near-stream Bh podzols with lower magnitude water fluctuations, presumably the result of higher saturated hydraulic conductivity in the near-stream zone [Detty and McGuire, 2010b]. Upslope of these soils was almost always typical podzols, which our threshold analysis has shown to have very infrequent water table incursion into the solum. Therefore, the observation of persistent water tables in the near-stream zone and typical podzols immediately upslope is consistent with the majority of event water being mobilized from the near-stream zone [McGlynn and McDonnell, 2003]. A direct connection between hillslope groundwater and the stream likely only occurs during large events, where water tables occur in the lower portion of typical podzol profiles. The discontinuities evident from our analysis suggest most hillslope water takes longer, deeper flow paths to the stream, likely through the glacial parent material of the C-horizon.";5.3;Implications for Runoff Generation;8415;WS3, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, United States;43,954892100000002;-71,722258199999999;0,420000000000000;3;Hillslope position;2;Rainfall intensity;N;Multiple properties described;Geological types described;Topography described;N;N;N;1,000000000000000;Expansion of saturated areas;Surf.Over.SE.Satexp;3,000000000000000;Infiltration into bedrock, Lateral matrix flow at soil horizons, Connectivity between hillslopes and channel;Sub.GW.BedInf, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix.Horiz, Sub.GWSW.Conn.Hill;1,000000000000000;N/A

Saturated hydraulic conductivity determined by bail tests ranged from 10-4 to 10-7 cm/s. Weak downward hydraulic gradients were also observed in hillslope areas and upward gradients were observed near localized seeps and tributary channels. From basic physical monitoring and observation it was found that groundwater flow pathways are typically fairly short, with seep flow contributing most groundwater to streamflow via channelized pathways. Depression storage is commonly observed even during dry periods, but its occurrence during these times is largely restricted to the bog and bog-forest zones. During dry periods, depression storage is encountered on forested hillslopes only for brief intervals during peak runo€ff. Depression storage occurs throughout the bog±forest complex during wetter periods in autumn and winter. [...] The role of groundwater in the runo€ regime of hypermaritime bog±forest complexes of the Prince Rupert region has not been investigated previously. From basic observations we can conclude that water reaching the ground surface passes through the subsurface along short flow pathways that terminate in local rills or seeps. The prevalence of low hydraulic conductivity organic soil promotes shallow water tables and sel€ectively reduces the rate of groundwater movement in deeper organic soils below about 0.5 m depth. This condition appears to limit interaction between bedrock and shallow groundwater, resulting in geochemically dilute waters and runoff€. Drainage from the slopes occurs primarily via channelized flow in seepage tracks, often deeply incised, that typically are connected to the main stream channel. Water with the distinct isotopic signature of shallow groundwater flow also has been observed at the bedrock interface, and is attributed to the presence of vertical bypass structures created by buried deadfall and/or root holes, although these have not been widely observed. The groundwater regime within bedrock has not been investigated, but recharge is expected to occur from the overlying organic layers, especially in the bog-filled depressions, owing to the fractured character of the rock mass. Bonell et al. (1998) describe analogous hydrological and isotopic responses in high-rainfall response-dominated tropical forested catchments of New Zealand and Australia with shallow soils (<3 m) overlying bedrock. At low rainfall intensities (<250 mm/day), they observed that water generally is routed to streamflow via the soil-groundwater system, which can be predominantly characterized as a first-in-first-out system, i.e. streamflow is dominated by old water. At high rainfall intensities (<250 mm/day), however, the flow capacity of these pathways is exceeded and alternative pathways involving rapid flow (i.e. rill and seep flow) are invoked, resulting in last-in-first-out behaviour, i.e. streamflow is dominated by new water. They concluded that these steep, flashy hydrological systems with shallow soils (3 m) overlying bedrock are well-represented by an ideal non-linear storage model that is comprised of a shallow, quick flow reservoir coupled to a deep slow flow reservoir (figure 11.19 in Bonell et al., 1998). This study indicates that a similar conceptual model may apply to temperate rainforests characterized by bog-forest vegetation. Although soil layers are considerably shallower in the present setting, variations in the organic content of soil, and variations in the depth of soils combine to produce considerable variability in water residence times in various terrain units within the watershed. Based on the studies of Bonell et al. (1998) it is probable that high intensity events (not observed in this study) may be characterized by a shift or perhaps a reversal in old and new water contributions.  Further physical monitoring and isotope hydrograph separation analysis will be required to refine and improve on this conceptual model of runoff€ generation. ;N/A;Study site, runoff mechanisms;2728;Smith Island, British Columbia, Canada;54,182364000000000;-130,211627999999990;0,330000000000000;2;Land use / Land cover;2;Season;Forest described;Multiple properties described;N;Topography described;N;Uncertainty described;N;2,000000000000000;Depression storage, Water Table;Surf.Water.Depr, Sub.GW.Store.Wtable;5,000000000000000;Vertical macropore flow, Exfiltration, Connectivity between hillslopes and channel, Gaining stream, Channel flow;Sub.Soil.Macro, Sub.GW.Ret.Exf, Sub.GWSW.Conn.Hill, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Chan.Flow;1,000000000000000;N/A

";N/A;N/A;N/A;Contributions of non-permafrost slope waters are considered to be minimal in view of the unsaturated conditions observed throughout the 1989 to 1990 period. Snow-melt occurred earlier here than on permafrost slopes, with no observed overland or subsurface flow. A deep water table (> 3.4 m) within clay to silty clay would further indicate only minor potential for deeper groundwater flow. On permafrost slopes, snowmelt occurred during 15 April to 1 May (Julian Day 105-120). Shallow active-layer water sampled in monitoring wells during the melt period was found to have d180 and d2H values intermediate between late-season active-layer water (old water) and snow (new water), suggesting mixing of these components. Rapid rise in water tables within the shallow active layer (= 0.15 m) resulted in runoff via overland flow (flow in rills between saturated depressions), and pipe flow (flow in 5-10 cm diameter, 1-10 m long frost cracks situated at or above the mineral soillorganic layer contact). The characteristics of overland flow and pipe flow were comparable to those described in previous studies in similar environments (Woo 1988, Woo and diCenzo 1988). The timing of overland flow discharge from a small runoff plot is shown in Fig. 3. Although no pipe flow measurements were made, the timing and isotopic similarity of pipe flow and overland flow suggests a similar generation mechanism. d180 and d2H values of overland flow and pipe flow were found to be heavier than snowpack values, indicating a significant old-water content (Table 2). QN/QT evaluated from Eq. (1) indicates that 50 to 60 % of instantaneous overland and pipe flow discharge is derived from over-winter active-layer storage (i.e. water existing prior to snow-melt). Evidently, mixing of snowmelt and in situ water occurred in the shallow active layer. As storage capacities were exceeded in the early freshet period, old and new water were delivered to the tributary by surface routes and shallow sub-surface routes in pipe structures. Following cessation of overland and pipe flow, the isotopic composition of streamflow rapidly returned to baseflow values. In light of the isotopic similarity between tributary baseflow and late season active-layer waters, replenishment of the tributary during quiescent periods was evidently occurring via the active-layer soil matrix. Visual observations during a rainy period in the later thaw season revealed that overland and pipe flow pathways had reactivated, however no detailed isotopic sampling was conducted during this time (see Fig. 3).;N/A;Runoff Sources and Pathway;221;Manners Creek (tributary site), Fort Simpson, North West Territories, Canada;61,751970000000000;-121,173147999999998;300,000000000000000;2;Land use / Land cover;4;Season;N;Soil types described;N;N;N;N;N;5,000000000000000;Regional Groundwater storage, Water table rise, Snow storage, Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Soil water storage;Sub.GW.Store.Region, Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Surf.Snow.Stor, Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.Soil.Store;5,000000000000000;Lateral macropore flow, Saturation excess flow, Rill flow, Mixing, Snowmelt;Sub.SSFlow.Macro, Surf.Over.SE, Surf.Over.Rill, Sub.Soil.Mix, Surf.Snow.Melt;1,000000000000000;N/A

In unsaturated off-channel areas infiltration capacity is often too high for these processes to occur. In wetlands, mixed water sources are delivered to the stream via fill and spill, which involves event water raising the groundwater table until depression storage is satisfied and then flow occurs. Macropore flow involves flow of mixed water predominantly through organic soils and interflow/return flows are shallow groundwaters that flow between mineral soil and peat, contributing either to fill and spill or macropore flow. The fill and spill process also applies to larger bodies of surface water including lakes and ponds that are often connected by permanent outlets to the tributaries. Flow from these sources is isotopically labelled as surface water due to exposure to evaporative isotopic enrichment. Groundwater sources also include shallow flow in drift aquifers and deeper sources, including bedrock aquifers or regional groundwater. In general, the residence time of water increases from runoff component (1) through to (8) (see Fig. 12). Deeper groundwater sources also tend to be more important lower down in the drainage network as the channels become more incised, in places within bedrock. If groundwater ridging is occurring in the watersheds, then it must lead to interaction with organic soils, otherwise we would not see increases in both groundwater and surface water contributions during the freshet or during rain events. Translatory flows appear to dominate runoff. Microtopography (hollows and hummocks) in organic terrain is important in the fill and spill process because it promotes subsurface interactions (Frei et al., 2010) and translatory flows. The fate of event water, if it does not fall in near-channel areas, is to become mixed with groundwater if recharged, or surface water if it lands on saturated wetlands and is exposed to evaporation.;4;Discussion;144;Athabasca Oil Sands region, Alberta, Canada;57,136749000000002;-111,610484999999997;132000,000000000000000;2;Land use / Land cover;1;N;N;Multiple properties described;N;Topography described;N;N;N;4,000000000000000;Water table rise, Depression storage, Lake storage, Depression storage;Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Surf.Water.Depr, Surf.Water.Lake, Surf.Water.Depr;11,000000000000000;Groundwater flooding, Snowmelt, Mixing, Organic layer interflow, SE flow from riparian zone, Channel interception, Evaporation, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Regional groundwater flow, Groundwater flow, Lateral matrix flow at soil-bedrock interface;Sub.GW.Ret.Flood, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.Soil.Mix, Sub.SSFlow.Organ, Surf.Over.SE.Rip, Chan.Int, Surf.ET.Evap, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.GW.Flow.Region, Sub.GW.Flow, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix.Bedrk;1,000000000000000;N/A

Overall <9% of storm discharge was new water (46 m3 of 512 m3 total discharge). Channel interception is estimated to be 31.4 m3 based on the precipitation amount and the stream channel area (<1.5 meters wide by <800 m long; <1% of watershed area). This estimate is close to the total new water calculated using O isotopes and supports our assumption that most new water is derived from channel interception. Separation using Sr isotopes indicates that there is very little shallow subsurface flow until the sharp rise in stream discharge. At peak discharge shallow subsurface flow comprises <40% of total discharge, a value which is maintained on the falling limb. Significant shallow subsurface flow at this stage of the year is consistent with higher soil moisture due to reduced transpiration as trees enter winter dormancy. This increased soil moisture provides a water source to generate shallow subsurface flow.
Separation of the September 1998 storm event (Figure 8b) with oxygen isotopes indicates that between 1030% of discharge is precipitation, with the greatest percent contribution occurring just prior to peak discharge. It is important to keep in mind that due to variation in the ´18O value of precipitation during this event, there is an overestimate of the precipitation component during the early part of the storm and an underestimate for the latter part of the storm. New water was <18% of total discharge (41.2 of 220.8 m3) which, again, is close to the estimated amount of channel interception (45.0 m3). Results of the hydrograph separation using Sr isotope ratios generates a result that includes negative shallow subsurface flow and groundwater flow greater than the actual stream discharge. This erroneous result is caused by both the overestimate of channel interception from the ´18O separation, and also the fact that changes in stream 87Sr/86Sr do not reflect any throughfall contributions which, based on changes in ´18O, are clearly significant. This is well illustrated on Figure 5 in which it is observed that the greatest shift in ´18O has no corresponding shift in 87Sr/86Sr. The problem here is most likely with the composition of our throughfall end-member. Because we did not collect end-member samples during this storm event it is difficult to accurately constrain the throughfall composition. Potential changes in end-member compositions (i.e., very low Sr concentration; 87Sr/86Sr ratio of throughfall similar to stream water) that may resolve this problem seem highly unlikely. Although the hydrograph separation produces unreasonable results, a qualitative assessment of the changes in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of stream water is possible. Because the total change in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio is smaller, and because this change only occurs during a brief period after peak discharge (Figure 5), one can infer that soil water makes up a significantly smaller component of the September 1998 storm compared to the November 1997 storm. The lack of shallow subsurface flow is not surprising for a storm event that occurred when trees were still actively transpiring and thus lowering soil moisture [Likens and Bormann, 1995]. As a result, precipitation during the growing season will enter the soil profile with some flowing quickly through macropores into the till, resulting in increased groundwater flow of old water [McDonnell, 1990], while the remainder enters the soil matrix but never reaches the saturation level necessary to generate shallow subsurface flow.
The hydrograph of the March 1999 snowmelt event (Figure 8c), where we did not analyze ´18O of stream water, was separated into shallow subsurface and groundwater flow paths using only Sr isotopes. Results indicate that soil water is a significant percentage of the storm flow on the rising limb of the hydrograph and reaches 40% immediately before peak discharge. This is in contrast to the two rain events where soil water is only significant on the falling limb of the hydrograph. On the falling limb of the snowmelt hydrograph, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of stream water increased to values higher than at the start of the storm event. Because of this our mixing model again produces erroneous results, with deep flow contributions greater than total stream discharge. As stated earlier, we believe this is caused by increased flow from the upper portion of the watershed as thawing progressed up the watershed.";5.4;Hydrograph Separation;10;Watershed 1, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, United States;43,952241500000000;-71,725983200000002;0,118000000000000;2;Hillslope position;8;Season and event;Vegetation described;N;Glacier described;N;N;N;N;1,000000000000000;Soil water storage;Sub.Soil.Store;7,000000000000000;Subsurface stormflow, Lateral macropore flow, Transpiration, Gaining stream, Snowmelt, Groundwater flow, Channel interception;Sub.SSFlow, Sub.SSFlow.Macro, Surf.ET.Transp, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.GW.Flow, Chan.Int;1,000000000000000;N/A

Valley-bottom riparian saturated areas are recharged by deep groundwater seepage (and therefore the high Si and Mg2+ concentrations in riparian waters, Table 1) while local groundwater discharged at seeps moved rapidly downslope as surficial runoff along the steep slope gradients. The hydraulic gradient for seep groundwaters is much greater than the seepage gradient in the riparian/wetland areas, especially for the headwater catchments. Although some seep groundwater likely recharges the valley-bottom riparian areas, a large fraction of the seep runoff is delivered to the stream along streamlets. This is the period when the potential for expression of seep runoff in streamflow is at its maximum. Riparian water contributions to streamflow are high at the large catchment scale (S1) which has a larger riparian reservoir.
Stage 2: Rising limb of the hydrograph
This stage comprises the sharp rise of the hydrograph with increasing contributions of throughfall. Throughfall is intercepted at surface-saturated areas and is delivered to the drainage network as saturation excess runoff. The relative fractions (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) of seep groundwater drop rapidly as large amounts of throughfall are mobilized. Contributions of riparian groundwater also increase due to: (a) displacement of riparian water by incident throughfall and precipitation (e.g., Waddington et al., 1993); (b) mixing and transport with throughfall water in saturation overland flow; and (c) displacement of riparian groundwater by initial (and increasing) inputs of hillslope interflow.
Stage 3: Just after peak flow and recession limb
Riparian groundwater contributions to streamflow reach their peak due to elevated hydraulic gradients associated with hillslope event water flux. This is displayed by the elevated groundwater elevations in the valley bottom locations. Throughfall contributions continue to occur from distal saturated areas which are now hydrologically connected to the drainage network under peak catchment wetness. Towards the end of the recession limb, riparian and throughfall contributions recede and the relative proportions of seep groundwater recover to pre-event values.";N/A;Conceptual model for runoff generation;125;Point Peter Brook watershed, New York, United States;42,439920000000001;-78,922889999999995;6,960000000000000;4;Hillslope position/Catchment spatial scale;3;Event;Wetland described;N;N;Slopes described;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Water table rise, Soil saturation, Riparian aquifer storage;Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Chan.Store.Rip;8,000000000000000;Exfiltration, Exfiltration, Overland Flow, Throughfall, Connectivity, Subsurface stormflow, Saturation excess flow, Riparian Groundwater Flow;Sub.GW.Ret.Exf, Sub.GW.Ret.Exf, Surf.Over, Surf.Int.Thru, Sub.GWSW.Conn, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.Over.SE, Sub.GW.Flow.Rip;1,000000000000000;N/A

Surface-applied dye tracers moved and arrived with the lead outflows, apparently along preferential flowpaths, and concentrations peaked shortly after trench flow initiated. This preferential network was not associated with visually apparent macropores. Conductivities of the toposils calculated from the dye tracer velocities ranged from 864 to 2240 mm/h and were 1.9 to 4.9 times greater than the bulk conductivity (460 mm/h) determined from mass balance at quasi steady-state. The bulk and the maximum conductivities were much greater than the median value of 100 mm/h for surface conductivities previously measured at this site using small-scale permeameters [Du et al., 2016], substantiating previous observations that small-scale conductivity measurements tend to be low-biased [Brooks et al., 2004]. Dye tracer arrivals, soil moisture time series, piezometric behavior, and trench outflows all suggested sequential and spatially variable thresholds for perching and for interflow initiation. Along the same contour, both the amount of precipitation necessary to initiate perching and the rate of drainage were highly variable. Observations were consistent with the fill and spill concept but suggested multiple successive fill and spill events that affected the progression of flows and piezometer levels through the event. The subsurface depressional storage on the argillic surface contributed to large and spatially variable interflow generation thresholds of 131 and 208 mm. Even on a small and apparently homogenous hillslope segment, interflow generation thresholds varied by 59% between the two collection drains, raising the question of how interception trench length and segmentation affect inference. Event water fractions of the trench outflows increased steadily with the irrigation depth, peaking at 50%. The tight relationship between the depth of irrigation and the event water fraction indicates that high storm-to-storm variability in event water fractions in the same watersheds observed in past studies may be substantially a function of storm size. The cumulative amount of preevent water in trench flow exiting the slope was greater than the estimate of preevent water in the A and E horizons. This suggests that there was exchange of preevent water in the BE and Bt horizons with event water moving to the trench. The lack of perching in most of the piezometers in the upper half of the plot suggests that some flow moved through higher conductivity layers in the BE transition and Bt horizons, below the level of the piezometers, and some flow moved as unsaturated flow through the sand. Downslope travel distances on this hillslope were limited by the percolation of water through the argillic Bt horizon. The cumulative water balance for this experiment, along with the piezometric behavior, agreed with predictions by the simple downslope travel distance model proposed by Jackson et al. [2014] and by the steady-state kinematic wave equation including percolation through the impeding layer. Cumulative trench outflows equaled 49% of input water, suggesting that about half of the plot area contributed interflow that reached the trench. The observed range of conductivities suggests a distribution of interflow travel distances, so some solutes may travel much farther than would be predicted from the average velocities.;N/A;Conclusions;6203;Watershed R, Fourmile Creek, Sandhills, North Carolina, United States;33,270198999999998;-81,634021000000004;0,450000000000000;2;Hillslope position;2;Event;N;Horizons described;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Perched water tables, Depression storage, Soil water storage;Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Surf.Water.Depr, Sub.Soil.Store;8,000000000000000;Vertical drainage to groundwater, Vertical macropore flow, Vertical matrix flow, Lateral macropore flow at soil-bedrock interface, Vertical matrix flow, Lateral matrix flow at soil horizons, Vertical macropore flow, Subsurface stormflow;Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.Soil.Macro, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.SSFlow.Macro.Bedrk, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix.Horiz, Sub.Soil.Macro, Sub.SSFlow;1,000000000000000;N/A

The thickness of unconsolidated material (overburden) above the bedrock surface ranges from 0 m to more than 130 m. Aquifer recharge in the study area results from the infiltration of precipitation on upland glacial sand and silty sand deposits, and from direct runoff from the uplands that infiltrates sandy deposits along some of the tributaries (Kappel and Young, 1989). Groundwater discharges from the watershed as springs in the Railroad Mills area and as seepage to Irondequoit Creek.

[...] Like Amatya et al. (1996) and Slattery et al. (2006), we found that soil properties, especially buried argillic horizons with low permeability (i.e., the throttle for lateral flow), strongly influenced runoff generation in these low-relief coastal plain regions [...] Our site, like that reported by Devito et al. (2005a), showed that dry catchment conditions frequently led to dis-connectivity of the uplands with the valley bottom and stream. This resulted in low runoff coefficients and the dominance of evaporation in the water balance. In addition, direct precipitation on the stream channel can alter the isotope signal, when flow is close to zero. This was observed during March 2011, when very heavy precipitation (´18O = 3.9 0) led to a deviation between stream isotope signals and riparian isotopic signals adjacent to the streams throughout the area. Figure 8 conceptually summarizes the runoff generation and isotopic signature at the study site. A key element is the rare or nonexistent connectivity in the hillsloperiparianstream continuum and the enrichment in heavy water isotopes in the riparian zone/wetlands that supplies baseflow. Further, the deeper groundwater system can interact with the groundwater of the riparian zone during wet conditions and is likely a major contributor to the riparian groundwater. [...] The strong evaporative enrichment of groundwater suggests groundwater recharge influenced by enriched soil water.  Streams and riparian groundwater were even more enriched in heavy isotopes, suggesting further isotopic enrichment of the riparian groundwater as it reemerged in the low-relief and slow-moving stream floodplain. Our measured isotopic enrichment and the low annual runoff coefficients suggest that evapotranspiration strongly influences the runoff dynamics in the R, B, and C watersheds, consistent with the behavior of other lower-relief watersheds in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA (La Torre Torres et al., 2011) and elsewhere (Devito et al., 2005a).;4;Discussion;131;3 watersheds (R, C, B) in Upper Fourmile Branch, South Carolina, United States;33,270198999999998;-81,634021000000004;0,450000000000000;6;Hillslope position;1;N;N;Horizons described;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;0,000000000000000;N/A;N/A;5,000000000000000;Channel interception, Intermittent streamflow, Evapotranspiration, Riparian Groundwater Flow, Evaporation;Chan.Int, Chan.Flow.Interm, Surf.ET, Sub.GW.Flow.Rip, Surf.ET.Evap;1,000000000000000;N/A

We argue that the Variable Sources Area Concept proposed by Hewlett (1982) is valid for the LCP region which perhaps represents the extreme landscape where the saturated area can expand during wet periods and contract during dry periods over a large magnitude.

The objective of this study was to utilize a hydropedology approach to examine the linkages between fragipans, PWTs, and catchment-scale hydrological processes such as soil water storage, runoff, and lateral throughflow. A 1.7-ha catchment dominated by Fragixeralfs (Fragic Luvisols) was instrumented with 135 automated shallow wells to monitor PWTs. Soil water content was measured with water content reflectometry probes, and catchment outflow was measured with a flume. A 35 m × 18 m plot was isolated hydrologically from the surrounding hillslope using tile drains and plastic sheeting to measure perched water outflow. Results show that during the wet winter and spring months, the transition from unsaturated to saturated conditions is accompanied by changes in volumetric water storage of only 45%. PWT levels are at the surface of < 2645% of the catchment soils during periods of high rainfall and snowmelt, thereby generating saturation-excess surface runoff from hillslopes. Observed solute movement via subsurface flow is very rapid and ranges between 2.9 and 18.7 m d 1 when PWTs are maintained in more-permeable Ap and Bw horizons. Subsurface lateral flow accounts for as much as 90% of the incident precipitation and snowmelt during early spring. Data indicate that the relatively shallow depth to the fragipans and high Ksat in surface soil layers combine to create a very flashy hydrological system characterized by considerable temporal and spatial variation in patterns of saturation-excess runoff.;N/A;Abstract;166;Troy, Idaho, United States;46,750000000000000;-116,750000000000000;0,017000000000000;1;N;2;Season;N;Multiple properties described;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Perched water tables, Soil saturation, Soil water storage;Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Sub.Soil.Store;4,000000000000000;Quickflow, Subsurface stormflow, Saturation excess flow, Snowmelt;Chan.Flow.Quick, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.Over.SE, Surf.Snow.Melt;1,000000000000000;N/A

A significant fraction of eventwater falling on hillslopes infiltrates to the impermeable bedrock via vertical preferential flow, while the remainder of the event water is routed via slower Darcian matrix flow where storage and mixing with preevent water occurs. A saturatedlayer consisting of event and preevent water forms above the bedrock over large portions of upslope areas in the basin, initiated by mixing of event water fluxes via macropore flow with soil water immediately above the bedrock and production of phreatic conditions. DOC results suggest that saturation doesnot occur by mixing of event and preevent water in the upper soil matrix and piston-type displacement of this water to the bedrock, since this would result in DOC levels in BR flow similar to those in the matrix soil water. Instead, high DOC concentrations in initial flow at the soil-bedroc kinterface provide strong evidence for mixing of DOC-rich event water with a thin layer of preevent water and subsequent rapid movement of this mixture along the soil-bedrock interface to the near-stream zone. Matrix water contributions become increasing important later in the event, as indicated by convergence of BR runoff and soil water DOC levels. Preevent contributions from near-stream groundwater and event water delivery via DPSA are still important storm flow components but are less significant than envisaged by the groundwater ridging mechanism. However, processes by which slope contributions interact with near stream soil and groundwater prior to discharge to the channel are unknown, and studies linking slope runoff with near-stream hydrologic conditions are needed;N/A;Conceptual Model of Runoff Production;1301;PC1-08 Plastic Lake Basin, Ontario, Canada;45,177759999999999;-78,827226999999993;0,032200000000000;2;Soil or Geology;2;Event;Forest described;Horizons described;Geological types described;N;N;Unknown items identified;N;2,000000000000000;Perched water tables, Riparian aquifer storage;Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Chan.Store.Rip;4,000000000000000;Lateral macropore flow at soil-bedrock interface, Vertical matrix flow, Vertical macropore flow, Mixing;Sub.SSFlow.Macro.Bedrk, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.Soil.Macro, Sub.Soil.Mix;1,000000000000000;N/A

Hydrologic response was dominated by monthly and multi-year variability at low elevations but by daily and monthly variabilities at high elevations. Much of the variability in hydrologic response is attributable to differences in rainfall amount, soil depth (soil water storage and release) and topography [17], [19], [44]. The low elevation response is attributable to the deep, relatively fine textured soils, which apparently require up to two days to transmit precipitation inputs to stream channels, and may continue to contribute water as baseflow for up to 5 months. The high elevation response is attributable to relatively shallow, coarser-textured soils that transmit precipitation inputs to the stream channel on average within one day, but only contribute baseflow for up to 2 months. [...] At Coweeta, deciduous forest canopies play an important, temporally and spatially varying role: in winter when canopies are leafless, their hydrologic role may be dominated by interception (possibly including some snow interception at high elevations), whereas in summer they exert a strong hydrologic influence through water uptake. Forests at Coweeta were affected by fire and windthrow 150 years ago, cultivation and grazing 80100 years ago, and extensive logging 75 years ago [4], [5], and the current second-growth forests are dominated by deciduous species. Because of soil depth and soil moisture availability, combined with the short period when the forest is in leaf, actual evapotranspiration accounts for only 2540% of precipitation on a mean annual basis at high-elevation basins with shallow soils, but over 50% at the low-elevation basins with deep soils. [...] Consistently rapid hydrologic responses at Coweeta 27, and inability to store snowmelt in basins at Hubbard Brook imply the existence of short flowpaths and relatively little groundwater storage in these basins. Intermediate responses, i.e. baseflow contributions for up to a month on average, at Coweeta high elevation and Andrews basins suggest that water may also be stored and drained from relatively fine-textured soil matrices. The most protracted hydrologic responses, i.e. water release over many months or even years at Luquillo, low-elevation Coweeta, and Andrews basins imply that these basins have the longest flowpaths through deep, fine-textured soil or fractured bedrock.;4;Discussion;1205;Coweeta, North Carolina, United States;35,059984000000000;-83,427240999999995;0,610000000000000;2;Topography;2;Season;Forest described;Soil texture described;N;Topography described;N;Unknown items identified;N;2,000000000000000;Soil water storage, Groundwater storage;Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.GW.Store;7,000000000000000;Vertical matrix flow, Evapotranspiration, Gaining stream, Canopy Interception, Canopy snow interception , Subsurface stormflow, Pistonflow;Sub.Soil.Matrix, Surf.ET, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Surf.Int.Int.Canopy, Surf.Snow.Canopy, Sub.SSFlow, Sub.GW.Disp.Piston;1,000000000000000;N/A

Daily scale responses are attributable to the timing of precipitation inputs (dominated by single-day events spaced by relatively dry intervals) combined with the shallow, coarse-textured soils and relatively steep slopes, which appear to transmit most water inputs rapidly to stream channels. The monthly scale, lagged response (Fig. 5), and the strong coupling of streamflow to precipitation at the annual timescale (Table 5) are attributable to the accumulation and melt of a seasonal snowpack, combined with the tendency of the soils to rapidly transmit snowmelt to channels. The basins at Hubbard Brook are spatially homogenous in their hydrologic behavior, perhaps because they were shaped by recent (Holocene) glaciation. [...] At Hubbard Brook, deciduous forest canopies play a dual hydrologic role. During the months when dominant forest vegetation is leafless, its hydrologic role is principally exerted through interception (primarily of snow), whereas during summer months, the interception role of the forest canopy may be less important than its water uptake (evapotranspiration). However, because of the short period when deciduous forest is in leaf, actual evapotranspiration accounts for less precipitation at Hubbard Brook than at any other site except Coweeta 27 (only 3540% of precipitation on a mean annual basis). [...] At the Andrews and Hubbard Brook, seasonal snowpacks store and release soil moisture at a time closer to the time of summer vegetation physiological activity than would be possible otherwise, especially given the limited soil moisture storage capacities at Hubbard Brook. At the Andrews, transient snowpacks which accumulate and melt at daily or weekly timescales also contribute to net storage and delayed release of moisture. [...] Consistently rapid hydrologic responses at Coweeta 27, and inability to store snowmelt in basins at Hubbard Brook imply the existence of short flowpaths and relatively little groundwater storage in these basins. ;4;Discussion;1205;"WS1,3,6,7,8; Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire, United States";43,954892100000002;-71,722258199999999;0,760000000000000;1;N;3;Season;Forest described;Soil texture described;Glacier described;Slopes described;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Groundwater storage, Soil water storage, Seasonal snow storage;Sub.GW.Store, Sub.Soil.Store, Surf.Snow.Stor.Season;5,000000000000000;Snowmelt, Subsurface stormflow, Evapotranspiration, Canopy Interception, Canopy snow interception ;Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.ET, Surf.Int.Int.Canopy, Surf.Snow.Canopy;1,000000000000000;N/A

Peat plateaus represent areas of saturated permafrost that rise above the surrounding terrain. This enables them to effectively impound water in the bogs, while re-directing flow in the fens. Owing to their relatively high topographic position and the limited water storage capacity within their active layer, peat plateaus also shed water to the surrounding wetlands. The flowpath then followed by this drainage water depends upon the type of wetland that receives it. Water entering channel fens is more likely to be conveyed toward the basin outlet, than water entering bogs. This conceptual model contributes to resolving some of the difficult issues in the hydrological modelling of northern basins, especially in relation to the storage and routing functions of wetlands. Runoff-generation algorithms in hydrological models must account for the storage capacity of the bogs. Similarly, routing algorithms in distributed hydrological models need to incorporate the network of channel fens. Preliminary studies suggest that surface roughness and channel slope may be the essential factors controlling the flow of surface water in channel fens.";N/A;SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS;62;Scotty Creek Catchment, Liard River, Northwest Territories, Canada;61,433726000000000;-121,546623699999998;152,000000000000000;3;Land use / Land cover;1;N;Wetland described;N;N;Topography described;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Permafrost storage, Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Soil saturation;Surf.Frozen.Perm, Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur;2,000000000000000;Organic layer interflow, SE flow from riparian zone;Sub.SSFlow.Organ, Surf.Over.SE.Rip;1,000000000000000;N/A

Vertical profiles of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) measured on a permafrost plateau exhibit uniformly high and low K in the upper and lower regions of the profile respectively, separated by a transition zone in which K decreases abruptly with depth (Figure 4). A similar depth-dependence of K was observed in other organic-covered terrains near Whitehorse, Yukon and at Siksik Creek near Inuvik, NWT (Quinton et al., 2008). Therefore, it appears to be a common feature of peat, in which K is strongly controlled by the pore size that decreases with depth as a result of the  decomposition of organic materials. The subsurface drainage from permafrost plateaus to their adjacent bogs and fens strongly depends on the depth of ground thaw, as the frozen soil is relatively impermeable to water. When the subsurface flow zone (i.e., thawed, saturated layer) is near the ground surface the flow rate is high, but as the soil thaws (i.e., frost table lowers) and the water table depth increases, the flow rate diminishes (Figure 4). The rate of soil thaw is influenced by soil moisture, as wet peat is a better conductor of energy from the ground surface to the thawing front (i.e., frost table) than dry peat (Hayashi et al., 2007). This is illustrated by the comparison of frost-table depths measured at the end of summer (late August-early September) and the amount of total water input (snowmelt and summer rain) over seven years of measurements at an instrumented permafrost plateau (Figure 5). The frost table depths were significantly correlated to the total water input, with deeper frost table in years with greater water inputs, than in years with lower precipitation depths. Other factors, such as the length of the snow-free season produced weaker correlations with thaw depth. The spatial pattern of soil thaw over a permafrost plateau is also affected by the spatial pattern of soil moisture. Detailed spatial surveys of the instrumented permafrost plateau showed that frost table depths were greater in locations with higher soil moisture content (Wright et al., 2009). As a result, the frost table forms an irregular topography, which controls the lateral flow of water sourced by infiltration and ice melt within the active layer. Under this condition, modelling runs on a 5 × 5 m plot indicate that runoff is generated only when frost table depressions are filled and become interconnected to form a continuous subsurface drainage pathway (Wright et al., 2009), similar to the fill and spill effects observed in  other regions (Spence and Woo, 2003; Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell, 2006).";N/A;Runoff Generation on Permafrost Plateaus;316;Scotty Creek Catchment, Liard River, Northwest Territories, Canada;61,433726000000000;-121,546623699999998;152,000000000000000;1;N;2;Interannual;N;Soil hydraulic properties described;N;Topography described;N;N;N;4,000000000000000;Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Soil water storage, Water table fall, Permafrost storage;Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Fall, Surf.Frozen.Perm;4,000000000000000;Subsurface stormflow, Groundwater flooding, Infiltration, Snowmelt;Sub.SSFlow, Sub.GW.Ret.Flood, Surf.Inf.Inf, Surf.Snow.Melt;1,000000000000000;N/A

At the same time, subsurface sensors showed the water table to be below the surface at locations 4, 6, 16 and 26. This suggests that surface runoff during that period was most likely due to the IE mechanism (Table IIIa, b, c and d). The subsurface sensor at location 6 having high soil hydraulic conductivity showed an increase in perched water table. This suggests that at location 6, a restrictive layer exists on which a perched water table builds up when the rainfall amount and intensity is high enough. Location 16 also shows features of the presence of a restrictive layer near the surface. From 1530 to 1550 hours, although the rainfall intensity decreased, locations 4, 6, 16 and 26 continued to show runoff, which was attributed to residual runoff from the high intensity rainfall period. Similar results were observed for event 2. The time period from 1620 to 1700 hours was selected to show the type of runoff generation mechanism that occurred during this storm (Table IVa, b, c and d). Analysis of the data shows that the rainfall intensity was of the order of the measured soil hydraulic conductivities at location4 and 16. Locations 4, 16 and 26 showed IE runoff during this period. Location 16 showed no runoff from1620 to 1630 hours. The same location showed IE runoff from 1640 to 1700 hours (Table IVc). The subsurface sensor, however, showed an increase in perched water table at this location. This could possibly be due to the restrictive layer near the surface as discussed earlier. Considering that the rainfall intensity during this event was not orders of magnitude higher than the soil hydraulic conductivity estimated for this site, it is not surprising that no runoff was initially observed at this location16. Location 6, which had a much higher hydraulic conductivity compared with the rainfall intensities for this event, showed no runoff. Furthermore, since this location also appears to have a restrictive layer near the surface, a perched water table builds up at this location as well. However, because of the medium rainfall intensity during this event, the water table did not reach the soil surface. For event 3, the time period from 0330 to 0350 hours was selected for discussion (Figure 4c). This period is the initial part of the long duration storm that lasted for 19 h35 min. During this period, rainfall intensity was much lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity at most of the locations within the field. During this event location 4and 26 showed runoff for the initial 10  15 min, followed by no runoff (Table Va, d). This was attributed to the initial existence of hydrophobicity of the soil. Location 6(Table Vb), which had a high soil hydraulic conductivity, did not show any runoff during this event. Also, with the exception of a short period, no runoff was observed allocations 4 and 26.;N/A;Runoff generation mechanism;4226;Sand Mountain Research and Experimental Station, DeKalb County, Alabama, United States;34,287858999999997;-85,968737000000004;0,001200000000000;4;Catchment spatial scale;3;Event;N;Horizons described;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Soil stratification, Hydrophobicity, Perched water tables;Sub.Soil.Store.Layer, Surf.Inf.Soil.Hyphob, Sub.GW.Store.Perch;3,000000000000000;Subsurface stormflow, Infiltration excess flow, Partial area IE flow;Sub.SSFlow, Surf.Over.IE, Surf.Over.IE.Part;1,000000000000000;N/A

D&B illustrated the functioning of the VSA concept as it relates to landscapes that have extensive areas with a hydrogeological/topographic limit to the conveyance capacity of the shallow subsurface. When and where that limit was exceeded, return flow/exfiltration occurred and was augmented by rainfall and/or snowmelt as SOF. [...] Like the Scandinavian catchments of Water's Way (Grip and Rodhe, 1985, 1994), hydrology at the SRRW is profoundly influenced by the glacial deposits that mantle the landscape. In particular, the dense silty basal till provides high storage capacity in a low-permeability material, which sustains baseflow. However, spatial heterogeneity in slope, soil drainage class and presence of a fragipan gives rise to contrasting hydrograph recession characteristics even in adjacent catchments at the SRRW (Comer and Zimmermann, 1969; Engman, 1981). Relative to the Scandinavian catchments of Water's Way, the SRRW has more rugged topography; thus, steeper hydraulic gradients are a greater consideration in water delivery from hillslope to stream. Another important factor in the hydrology is the jointing and fracturing, which form primary controls on drainage patterns (Newell, 1970) and spring locations (Dunne, 1980). The glacial advances scoured and re-deposited material in patterns determined by the direction of ice flow over the pre-existing topography (Newell, 1970). The post-glacial hydrology likely reflects only minor adjustments from pre-glacial drainage patterns, but major shifts in storage capacity, permeability and hydrologic flow paths. [...] At the SRRW, mixing of return flow and direct precipitation to generate SOF provides an explanation for variation in stream chemistry and new water and solute inputs while old water dominates stormflow.

Our findings show that for nearly 40% of storms, soil moisture peaked prior to runoff (Figure 8 and Table S4) indicating potential subsurface contributions from hillslopes to runoff at the catchment outlet. Similar results have been noted in other headwaters where subsurface flows from riparian zones influence streamflow (McGlynn & McDonnell, 2003; Penna et al., 2011). Past work at Coweeta implicates shallow groundwater from NS areas as a major contributor to streamflow responses to storms (Hewlett & Hibbert, 1967; Singh et al., 2018). The results from this study suggest that unsaturated flow from NS areas of hillslopes may also contribute to streamflow generation. Our findings are further supported by recent work demonstrating the coupling of unsaturated flow and shallow groundwater at Coweeta, and the relationship of both fluxes to streamflow at the catchment outlet (Scaife et al., 2020). Storm properties appear to mediate relationships between soil moisture and runoff responses at Coweeta (Figure 8). Storm depth partly explained this relationship, and a possible mechanism could be enhanced hydrologic connectivity and greater subsurface flows from hillslopes to streams during larger storms (e.g., McGlynn & McDonnell, 2003; Penna et al., 2011; Scaife et al., 2020). Mean storm intensity also appears to mediate lags between soil moisture and runoff responses, likely because the rapid propagation of wetting fronts resulted in a shorter lag between soil moisture and runoff. Overall, these results emphasize the influence of storm properties on the soil moisture-runoff relationship at event scales. [...] In contrast, we did not detect any significant effect (p > 0.05) of preferential flow on soil moisture-runoff relationships, indicating the insensitivity of variable preferential flows along hillslopes to soil moisture-runoff relationships.

Basin-wide trace experiments using environmental isotopes (18O, deuterium, tritium) and hydrometric studies carried out in hydrogeologically diverse watersheds, indicate that for all except the most intense rain storms and the most prolific melting days, groundwater dominates the runoff hydrographs in the study basins. The increased groundwater discharge during runoff events is apparently related to a rapid rise in hydraulic head along the perimeter of transient and perennial discharge areas. This groundwater ridging phenomenon probably arises from the almost instantaneous conversion of the near-surface tension-saturated capillary fringe into phreatic water. The ridging precedes, and is apparently independent of the response of the rest of the basin. In addition to its compatibility with several of the field observations commonly associated with contemporary concepts of runoff generation, the groundwater discharge theory explains some of the temporal variations in stream water chemistry which are not adequately accounted for by other theories.;N/A;Abstract;45;Ruisseau des Eaux Volees, Canada;47,270620000000001;-71,139750000000006;3,900000000000000;2;Catchment spatial scale;2;Season and rainfall intensity with snow;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;2,000000000000000;Groundwater storage, Groundwater ridging;Sub.GW.Store, Sub.GW.Disp.Ridge;3,000000000000000;Groundwater flow, Capillary rise, Snowmelt;Sub.GW.Flow, Sub.Soil.Matrix.Capil, Surf.Snow.Melt;1,000000000000000;N/A

The spring freshet is a predominant feature of this hydrological regime (Figure 10a). During this time, contributing areas can be large with significant portions of the basin hydrologically connected to the outlet. This can be dampened when dry conditions during the previous freezeup leave large storage deficits relative to snowmelt inputs in soil-filled areas and lakes. Runoff from exposed bedrock carries solutes into downslope soil filled areas where it is augmented by local runoff generation and additional solute load. The frost table at this time of year is shallow, so runoff pathways tend to be in shallow soil depths where DOC can be transported downslope. Inorganic nitrogen sources are available because most vegetation is dormant until after the freshet when the soils thaw and the growing season begins. The remainder of the summer is typically characterized by evapotranspiration rates that exceed rainfall, such that the water table elevation drops in concert with the frost table, and large storage deficits develop in lakes and soil-filled components of the landscape (Figure 10b). Runoff from exposed bedrock carrying solutes is intercepted in the soil-filled areas and goes into storage. During the typically dry summer conditions, soil-filled areas are hydrologically disconnected from the stream and do not contribute runoff, suppressing chemical transport (e.g., late summer 2012/2013). There can be some subsurface transport of water, solids, and carbon, but inorganic nitrogen tends to be efficiently used by the vegetation with little left for transport downstream. Lake levels decline from the low headwater runoff, reducing streamflow. [...] However, when autumn rainfall is sufficient, lateral flows from bedrock can cause water tables to rise and overcome storage deficits in soil-filled areas. The interaction of subsurface flow with deeper mineral soils at the base of the thick active layer may increase solute loads. Saturation of soils also maintains the water table near the topographic surface so that the majority of water flux is through high hydraulic conductivity zones of organic-rich soils, which augments the carbon flux. Inorganic nitrogen loading begins to increase in the fall as vegetation goes into senescence. During a typical recession, the conditions illustrated in Figure 10b likely continue right into the period when freezeback begins. A comparison of Figures 10b10d highlights the differences the model suggests exist in water, carbon, solute, and nitrogen fluxes that occur during a period of enhanced winter streamflow. By midwinter during the periods of enhanced winter streamflow, the freezeback of soils has been completed, isolating most terrestrial areas from the lake-stream network. High autumn rainfall-runoff results in a high level of storage in the lakes and an ample volume of water available to provide steady streamflow through the winter. ;6;Conceptual Model of Chemistry During Winter;123;Moss subwatershed, Baker Creek watershed, Yellowknife Northwest Territories, Canada;62,600000000000001;-114,430000000000007;9,300000000000001;3;Soil or Geology;3;Season;Seasonal change discussed;N;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;5,000000000000000;Lake storage, Soil saturation, Soil water storage, Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Permafrost storage;Surf.Water.Lake, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Sub.Soil.Store, Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Surf.Frozen.Perm;8,000000000000000;Snowmelt, Connectivity between hillslopes and channel, Subsurface stormflow, Reinfiltration, Evapotranspiration, Organic layer interflow, IE flow from impermeable areas, Channel flow;Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.GWSW.Conn.Hill, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.Inf.Inf.Reinf, Surf.ET, Sub.SSFlow.Organ, Surf.Over.IE.Imp, Chan.Flow;1,000000000000000;N/A

Even the fragipan soils near the stream, which have only limited moisture holding capacity and root penetration as a result of the confining layer, remain relatively moist because of this frequent rainfall and their proximity to the high water table. Soil moisture is generally variable only to about the 100cm depth[Gburek, 1977]. Below this depth soil moisture content remains nearly constant at near field capacity throughout the year. Based on measurements from more than 30 groundwater wells, Urban [1977] constructed a water table map for WE-38. The groundwater profile is highly correlated with topography. Because of the relatively high moisture content of the soils the actual evapotranspiration (ET) is at or  near its potential rate much of the time. There are short periods, however, during which soil moisture deficit limits evapotranspiration. Gburek [1977] estimated that baseflow at WE-38 is about 70% of yearly streamflow.;3.1;Mahantango Creek Experimental Catchment;1809;WE-38, Mahantango Creek Experimental Catchment, Pennsylvania, United States;40,705632999999999;-76,587768999999994;7,200000000000000;1;N;1;N;N;N;Geological types described;Topography described;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Tension storage, Water Table, Soil stratification;Sub.Soil.Store.Tens, Sub.GW.Store.Wtable, Sub.Soil.Store.Layer;3,000000000000000;Evapotranspiration, Gaining stream, Capillary rise;Surf.ET, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.Soil.Matrix.Capil;1,000000000000000;N/A

This was further highlighted in the headwater catchment groundwater wells in Event 2 (Figure 11). Impeding soil horizons due to shifts in permeability or saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth have been shown to drive the redistribution of water across hillslopes (Elsenbeer, 2001; Heller & Kleber, 2016; McDaniel et al., 2008). These impeding layers can direct rapid subsurface flow paths laterally, while slower vertical percolation through both the soil matrix and preferential pathways can allow a deeper groundwater system to develop simultaneously (Du et al., 2016). In this study, we observed that shallow flow paths dominated runoff dynamics, suggesting an impeding layer strongly routed shallow flow laterally. We showed that stormflow-driven contributions, which were controlled by shallow flow paths, dominated the ASDN expansion in headwaters (Figure 5). Baseflow-associated ASDN expansion comprised a smaller component of drainage network dynamics in the headwaters. The seasonal rise and fall of the deep water table drove this baseflow-associated expansion and contraction during periods of intermittent runoff (Figure 5). As highlighted in the headwater catchment groundwater wells in Event 1 (Figure 11), groundwater levels were elevated prior to the event, which allowed for rapid activation of shallow flow paths during events. This dynamic allowed stormflow-driven ASDN expansion to still play a substantial role during periods of persistent baseflow contributions.
The composition of baseflow-associated versus stormflow-driven ASDN varied across the two watershed scales. The overall influence of baseflow-associated flow paths on network length increased with increasing watershed scale (Figure 5). However, even at the scale of the entire basin, stormflow-driven flow path contributions played an important role in runoff generation and ASDN expansion. The groundwater dynamics in wells located in the lowlands suggested a strong relationship between groundwater levels and runoff regardless of season (Figure 8c). High runoff at the entire basin outlet was dependent on high groundwater levels in the lowlands. However, it is in these landscape positions where the stratigraphy of the subsurface appeared to matter less for runoff generation because the continual rise of the deep water table disallowed any perching of a shallow water table to occur. We observed that lowland groundwater levels flattened out at lower runoff values and at a higher level than the shallow hillslope wells. However, the overall shape of the relationship between lowland groundwater levels and runoff at the entire basin outlet (Figure 8c) was generally similar to the relationship between the shallow, perched, transient water table and runoff in the headwater catchment (Figure 8a). This suggests similar influences of shallow groundwater on runoff across watershed scales. In both Event 1 and 2, lowland groundwater responded to precipitation inputs similarly to shallow groundwater in the headwaters (Figures 11 and 12).
The bedrock groundwater system exhibited strong seasonality that was related to the longitudinal expansion of the baseflow-associated ASDN. The groundwater level rise in the bedrock well was driven by recharge from precipitation, although the amount of percolation was influenced by evapotranspirative demands in the shallower subsurface environment (Figure 8d). When evapotranspiration was low and shallow soil water content was high, more percolation occurred, which raised the bedrock groundwater levels. When evapotranspiration was high, drainage of the aquifer outpaced vertical recharge. This recharge dynamic mirrored the deep groundwater well in the upper hillslope in the headwater catchment (Figure 8b), suggesting these groundwater systems were vertically connected or representative of the same deep groundwater system. Furthermore, groundwater in these two deep wells showed similar influences on runoff at both watershed scales. Event-driven runoff at the headwater catchment or the entire basin outlet was not related to groundwater dynamics in these deep zones (Figures 8b, 8d, and 11). However, these deep groundwater systems contributed to the spatial presence of baseflow, which was seen in Event 1 when the deep groundwater system was actively contributing to baseflow preevent (Figure 11).";4.1.2;Vertically Partitioned Subsurface Flow Paths Drive Landscape Element Runoff Contributions and Drainage Network Dynamics;1592;Duke Forest Research Watershed, North Carolina, United States;36,036517000000003;-79,078714000000005;0,033000000000000;2;Catchment spatial scale;2;Season;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;5,000000000000000;Water table rise, storage-discharge relationship, Water table fall, Perched water tables, Groundwater storage;Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Sub.GW.Store.Stdis, Sub.GW.Store.Fall, Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Sub.GW.Store;10,000000000000000;Evapotranspiration, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Gaining stream, Vertical macropore flow, Displacement of groundwater, Ephemeral streamflow, Intermittent streamflow, Lateral macropore flow at soil horizons, Vertical matrix flow, Lateral macropore flow at soil horizons;Surf.ET, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.Soil.Macro, Sub.GW.Disp, Chan.Flow.Ephem, Chan.Flow.Interm, Sub.SSFlow.Macro.Horiz, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.SSFlow.Macro.Horiz;1,000000000000000;N/A

Discharge of water from deep ground-water sources occurs throughout the year, and is the principal source of stream flow during the dry summer months. This water has typically moved through bedrock fractures and bedding planes (fig. 2), and generally remains below the surface for several months to more than one year. Some water moves through the matrix of the bedrock, but much slower than through the fractures and bedding planes. The discharge rate of these springs tends to vary from season to season, but does not respond to individual storms (fig. 3A; Burns and others, 1998). During extended periods of rainfall or snowmelt, rates of recharge can exceed rates of discharge, which results in upward movement of the water table (the level below which all pore spaces and fractures are filled with water). In March or April the water table is likely to be in the soil profile, within centimeters of the surface, whereas in late summer, the water table is likely to be below the soil profile, and possibly below the till (fig. 3B, Burns and others, 1998). As the water table rises, subsurface water is able to discharge from the till and the soil, as well as from bedrock (fig. 2). When the water table rises into the soil, high stream flow is maintained between storms, and rapid increases in stream flow occur during rainstorms and snowmelt, as ephemeral streams form in channels that are dry throughout most of the year. Stream water under these conditions is a mixture of ground water and soil water that reflects a range of subsurface-residence times. During drier times of the year, heavy rainstorms can also rapidly increase stream flows for short periods of time, through lateral transport of water through the soil and upper ground water reservoirs, even though the water table is deep in the till or bedrock (Brown and others, 1999). Once the rain stops, however, streamflow quickly recedes to low, pre-storm levels. ";N/A;"Discharge of Ground Water and

Overland flow is minimal in Walker Branch as a result of very high infiltration capacity of surface soils, but convergence of subsurface flow on hillslopes results in initiation of surface flow in an extensive network of ephemeral stream channels during storms, consistent with predictions from a topography-based model (Clapp et al., 1992). Recent studies conducted in a small (0.5 ha), upper hillslope subcatchment of Walker Branch have shown that perched water tables develop in the upper soil profile in response to moderate-large storms and generate most of the subsurface stormflow via macropores during these events (Wilson and Luxmoore 1988; Wilson et al., 1990, 1991a). Studies of solute transport in this subcatchment have indicated extensive flushing of water held in small pores in the soil matrix into the preferential flow network during storms (Jardine et al., 1990; Wilson et al., 1991b). Studies of storm hydrogeochemical response at the whole catchment scale showed that both shallow and deep flowpaths were important in generating storm streamflow and that water chemistry differed considerably between flowpaths (Mulholland et al., 1990). More recently, Genereux et al. (1993b), using 222Rn and Ca concentrations in an end-member mixing analysis, identified three distinct flowpaths generating streamflow in Walker Branch, the importance of each varying spatially (along the perennial stream) and with streamflow. These results suggest a three component model of hydrologic flowpaths in Walker Branch (Fig. 1).

During summer storm events, the surface runoff and near-surface throughflow components of stormflow contributed directly to peak QO, while inputs to streamflow from the slower process of groundwater recharge contributed more to the falling limb of the hydrograph. Groundwater levels further upslope from riparian areas were found to be very responsive during rainfall events, but downslope riparian areas buffered this response to lag peak QO. During pure radiation-induced melt events, meltwaters initially contributed more to groundwater recharge than to the surface runoff and near-surface throughflow components of stormflow. As groundwater levels progressively rose, however, the transmissivity feedback mechanism became increasingly active, and more conductive superficial flowpaths rapidly transported ever greater amounts of lateral flow to streams. This resulted in a strong coupling of riparian area groundwater fluctuations to runoff during melt events, with peak groundwater levels experiencing little or no lag to peak QO. Groundwater levels along well transects varied from weak to strong, with the highest mean correlations existing in the upper elevations. The two upper elevation riparian zones were also found to be closely correlated, indicating that there is a common hydrologic pattern in the upslope areas of the watershed, which can be identified and potentially modelled.";N/A;Conclusions;64;Upper Penticton Creek Watershed Experiment, British Columbia, Canada;49,646130399999997;-119,394603500000002;4,740000000000000;1;N;2;Season;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;4,000000000000000;Groundwater storage, Water table rise, Riparian aquifer storage, Channel storage;Sub.GW.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Chan.Store.Rip, Chan.Store;6,000000000000000;Lateral matrix flow, Subsurface stormflow, Snowmelt, Overland Flow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Connectivity;Sub.SSFlow.Matrix, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.Snow.Melt, Surf.Over, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.GWSW.Conn;1,000000000000000;N/A

The predominance of interannual variability in the glacierized basin streamflow was due to hydrometeorological factors that affected ice melt with much smaller impacts from firn melt and rainfall-runoff. Annual streamflow was significantly correlated with annual air temperature, as well as summer rainfall and winter snowfall. The negative correlation with winter snowfall and with timing of ice exposure, concomitant with the lack of association between snowmelt and streamflow indicates that winter conditions play a role in streamflow variability by regulating subsequent summer ice exposure and albedo in the PGRB. Lower snowfall reduces summer albedo on the glacier. Snowmelt, whilst generating a larger fraction of streamflow, was a small source of interannual streamflow variability because high snowfall years were also low ice melt years due to the impact of deep snowpack in covering and protecting glacier ice from melting until late in the summer.

A comparison of high and low streamflow years showed that streamflow in high flow years was 41% greater than in low flow years. High flow years were warmer (+1.43°C), rainier (+145	mm) and less snowy (295	mm w.e.) than low flow years. These differences in temperature and precipitation caused earlier snowmelt (10	days), enhanced ice melt (+103%) and firn melt (+162%), and greater rainfall-runoff (+146%). As low snowfall years were warmer and rainier years than high snowfall years, rainfall and firn melt runoff sources also increased with ice melt in these years.

Observations of snowmelt on slopes showed the importance of forest density in moderating differences in incoming short and longwave radiation (Ellis et al. 2011). Model development based on these studies included short and longwave radiation under canopies, turbulent transfer under canopies and the interception, unloading and sublimation of snow in forest canopies. Model results showed that slope and aspect are not important for melt under forest canopies but are extremely important for forest clearings (Ellis et al. 2013). In the alpine zone around Fisera Ridge, studies of blowing snow transport and sublimation and snowmelt on slopes were conducted. MacDonald et al. (2010) found that 20% of alpine seasonal snowfall sublimated from blowing snow and that snow was almost completely eroded from windblown slopes, causing deposition on lee slopes to be more than double snowfall. Accumulation of snow in the forest edge at tree line was found to be the highest in Marmot Creek. DeBeer and Pomeroy (2009, 2010) report the distributions of snow water equivalent (SWE) can be described/modeled by lognormal distributions when stratified by terrain classes (i.e., hydro- logic response units). The use of effective or basin average parameters to model snow cover disappearance results in large errors. They showed that snowpack cold content caused a spatial variation in melt rate where shallow snow melted earlier than deeper snow under similar energy inputs, and that this was an important factor in calculating snowmelt runoff from the Mt.

In the Archer Creek watershed, streamflow generation and NO3 release are concentrated in hillslope hollows that appear to provide the primary mixing zone for soil water and deeper till groundwater. The watershed has landscape features that are typical of the hydrologically complex Adirondack Mountains. The watershed was glaciated as recently as 10,00015,000 years ago and therefore has a relatively immature drainage system that is exemplified by several hillslope hollows that contain no stream channels but where water rushing beneath the ground surface was audible. Water appears to flow along the soil-till interface between rocks and boulders that line the hollows. These rocks are overlain by a thin layer of soil, but there is little soil between the rocks at the till surface. We hypothesize that soil water in and near hillslope hollows was mobilized by infiltrating event water and by a rising water table and then rapidly transmitted to the stream along the soil-till interface (Figures 11a11c). The soil-till interface is typically characterized by an abrupt reduction in hydraulic conductivity in the till. Soil water mixed with deeper till water that flowed into the hollows from upslope groundwater springs or rose into the soils as the water table elevation increased during storms (Figure 11). At the break in slope in the valley bottom this well-mixed soil water and groundwater was transmitted to the stream through rivulets and wetland stream channels during base flow and small storms or across the wetland surface during larger storms when the wetland water table intersected the ground surface. These pathways through the near-stream zone allowed little interaction with wetland groundwater and therefore soil water and till groundwater reached the channel with little chemical alteration [McHale, 1999]. Draining soil water mixed with groundwater to sustain base flow after storms. During dry conditions, as soil water became less important to streamflow, till groundwater (and in very low flow conditions, near-stream wetland groundwater) began to dominate streamflow.;5.2;Conceptualization of NO3 Release;13;Archer Creek watershed, New York, United States;43,993389000000001;-74,245337000000006;1,350000000000000;1;N;1;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;6,000000000000000;Channel storage, Water table rise, Riparian aquifer storage, Soil water storage, Soil saturation, Groundwater storage;Chan.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Chan.Store.Rip, Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Sub.GW.Store;9,000000000000000;Saturation excess flow, Topographic convergence, Mixing, Springflow, Gaining stream, Lateral macropore flow at soil-bedrock interface, Infiltration, Vertical matrix flow, Rill flow;Surf.Over.SE, Sub.SSFlow.Conv, Sub.Soil.Mix, Sub.GW.Ret.Spr, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.SSFlow.Macro.Bedrk, Surf.Inf.Inf, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Surf.Over.Rill;1,000000000000000;N/A

There is no linear trend in total (p = .14), stormflow (p = .91), or baseflow (p = .83) discharge over the 50 years. In this catchment, stormflow likely reflects mainly precipitation falling on lakes and wetlands that are contiguous with the stream channels because upland soils are highly permeable and there are few impervious surfaces and little overland runoff from uplands to the streams. This is supported by the comparison of annual stormflow volumes to the annual precipitation falling on contiguous lakes and wetlands: on average, stormflow amounts to 57% (range, 4473%) of the precipitation with no linear trend over the 50 years (p = .09, data not shown). The balance, which equates to a mean of 408 mm year1, could largely be explained by evapotranspirative losses from the lakes and wetlands. If stormflow originating as overland flow from the uplands were important, the total stormflow volume would exceed the precipitation on lakes and wetlands.
Our annual water balances for Augusta Creek resemble earlier estimates calculated by Rheaume (1990) over three representative years (1971, 1977, and 1985), which indicated that 62%, 65%, and 59%, respectively, of the annual precipitation was returned to the atmosphere as ET, mainly during the growing season (MaySeptember), although those estimates included ET from contiguous lakes and wetlands as well as uplands. That study also employed hydrograph separation to estimate that about 75% of the annual stream flow in those years was supported by groundwater discharge; our estimate of mean baseflow contribution over the 50-year period is 78%.";3.2;Catchment hydrology;659;Augusta Creek, Michigan, United States;42,353373400000002;-85,353889400000000;95,000000000000000;1;N;1;N;N;Soil hydraulic properties described;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Soil saturation, Lake storage, Groundwater storage;Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Surf.Water.Lake, Sub.GW.Store;5,000000000000000;Gaining stream, Quickflow, Channel flow, Overland Flow, Evapotranspiration;Sub.GWSW.Gain, Chan.Flow.Quick, Chan.Flow, Surf.Over, Surf.ET;1,000000000000000;N/A

The average annual ET rate for LRB has been quantified as 47% to 88% of annual rainfall (Bosch et al., 2004). Evapotranspiration was determined as the difference between annual rainfall and annual water loss. Annual water losses included annual streamflow and losses to regional groundwater. Losses to regional groundwater were assumed to be 1% of annual rainfall (Sheridan, 1997). In the LREW, streamflow is typically greater in the winter and early spring than during the summer and fall months (Sheridan, 1997; Shirmohammadi et al., 1986). Analyses of long-term hydrological trends have indicated that the winter and spring months typically have higher rainfall and lower ET (Bosch et al., 2017) which create greater soil moisture and aquifer recharge, increasing surface runoff responses and groundwater contributions to streamflow. In the LREW, direct surface runoff can vary between 5% and 40% of annual rainfall while shallow subsurface interflow can vary between 2% and 35% of annual rainfall (Asmussen & Ritchie, 1969; Bosch et al., 2012; Hubbard & Sheridan, 1983).

Baseflow is particularly important in this region of rich surface and subsurface water resources that are essential for agriculture. In the LREW, baseflow was found to produce 53% of annual streamflow while stormflow was found to produce 47% (Bosch et al., 2017). In other Coastal Plain watersheds of similar size and having similar characteristics, baseflow ranging from 58% to 73% has been reported (Novak et al., 2003). Due to the highly variable transmissivity of the surficial aquifer, baseflow contributions to streamflow can be quite temporally variable. In the LREW, contributions of baseflow to streamflow have been found to vary seasonally as a function of varying ET levels and aquifer storage (Bosch et al., 2017). Baseflow was the greatest during the months from December through May (55%57%) and the least during the months from June through November (43%46%). Annual baseflow was found to decrease with increasing annual rainfall, indicating that during high rainfall years saturation excess driven stormflow increases in the LREW. Hydrograph analysis indicated an average stormflow duration of 7	days in the largest Little River Watershed (LRB, Figure 1), typically extended by interflow in this watershed (Bosch et al., 2017).

While row-crops across the LREW play an important economic and environmental role, the LREW landscape is dominated by a dense dendritic network of stream channels bordered by riparian forest wetlands (Asmussen et al., 1979). Within LRB, 22% of the area is covered with upland forests while 28% is covered by riparian forests (Bosch et al., 2004, Bosch et al., 2006 LandSat data). These forested areas play a key role in the LREW hydrology and water quality. Evapotranspiration for the forested portion of the watershed is considered much larger than ET from the row-crops and pasture. Bosch et al. (2014) measured transpiration rates for a forested slash pine (P. elliottii Engelm.) riparian buffer and quantified the rates to be 1114	mm for the period from April to December, or 103% of potential ET.

(4 Discussion) Surface water ponds throughout the watershed used to supply irrigation water are typically installed on first order streams. These ponds are frequently supplemented with groundwater from the deeper Floridan Aquifer. High volumes of irrigation would thus be expected to influence runoff by introducing inputs in addition to rainfall. While the fraction of irrigated land in LRN is greatest, this does not appear to have an impact on streamflow or Sratio in that watershed. Because most of the irrigation occurs during the summer period when ET is very high and landscape conditions are typically dry, the increased irrigation does not appear to impact streamflow at the levels of irrigated land observed here. [...] he water yield-drainage area relationship observed here is consistent with that of a drainage network that intercepts surface runoff and lateral subsurface flow from uplands and has low deep seepage losses [...] A slight decrease in water yield is observed as the watershed area increases (Figure 5) (trend not found significant, ± =	0.05). Based upon the general trend obtained from the fitted line to the loglog plot, the water yield decreases from the smallest watershed studied here (LRM) to the largest studied (Alapaha) the water yield decreases from 390 to 274	mm. This decrease indicates increasing consumptive water use with increasing open water/wetland area in the region, attributed to increased ET that occurs with increasing relative open water and wetlands.";1.2;Hydrology and evapotranspiration;2;Little River Experimental Watershed, Georgia, United States;31,481667000000002;-83,584166999999994;334,000000000000000;2;Land use / Land cover;3;Season and wetness;Vegetation types described;N;N;N;N;N;N;5,000000000000000;Surface water storage , Groundwater storage, Soil water storage, Soil saturation, Depression storage;Surf.Water, Sub.GW.Store, Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Surf.Water.Depr;9,000000000000000;Gaining stream, Water loss to deep groundwater, Riparian transpiration, Evapotranspiration, Overland Flow, Channel flow, Saturation excess flow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Subsurface stormflow;Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.GW.Loss.Deep, Surf.ET.Transp.Rip, Surf.ET, Surf.Over, Chan.Flow, Surf.Over.SE, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.SSFlow;1,000000000000000;N/A

Prior to peak flow the groundwater component was greater than this and after peak flow the groundwater component was less, reaching a minimum of about 45% one week after peak flow. Rain during the major runoff period in April does not need to be considered as a component of runoff since the amount involved was insignificant (< 2%) relative to the amount of water stored in the snowpack prior to melting Provided the unsaturated zone is not frozen with 'concrete' frost, melting of the snowpack will cause meltwater to infiltrate the subsurface and to recharge the zone of groundwater saturation. Continuous water-level measurements in piezometer Hl-l.8 m near stream B2 during a two-week period in April 1984 show a diurnal cycle in water-level fluctuations that are related to daytime melting of the snowpack and infiltration of the meltwater (Fig. 7). However, isotopic measurements of the groundwater at three depths in piezometer HI indicate that the meltwater itself penetrated to a depth of < 1.8 m, at least during the period of maximum runoff in mid-April (Fig. 8). The water-level fluctuations shown in Fig. 7 represent the pressure pulses generated by fluctuations in the overlying water table as meltwater infiltrated the shallow subsurface, displacing premelt subsurface water downward and laterally through the groundwater flow system. Infiltration of meltwater into the shallow subsurface and mixing with premelt water was observed at the hillslope piezometer HU- 0.7m (Fig. 8). Groundwater at this site on November 24, 1983, had an 180 of - 10.4%o, which represents the 180 of the very shallow subsurface water in the hillslopes following the autumn rains and prior to the onset of snowmelt. Meltwater infiltration near HU resulted in an 180 decrease of almost 7%o relative to the premelt hillslope groundwater 180 value. Compared to stream B1, stream B2 is relatively small in length and low in discharge and there is no isotopic evidence to indicate significant variations in the proportion of groundwater from the upper reaches of the stream to its mouth (Table 3). [&] On July 14-15, 1984, we sampled a major summer storm runoff event in stream B1 using a rain-activated automatic sampler (ISCO). Approximately 41mm of rain having an 180 of -4.5%0 fell on the watershed, generating the runoff hydrograph shown in Fig. 16. The ~sO increased from a base-flow value of - 13.2%o to a maximum of - 10.5%0, and the pH depression was approximately 0.5pH units. At peak flow the pre-event component was about 70% of the total flow. Prior to and following peak flow the pre-event component was even larger. The conclusion that pre-event groundwater is the major source of storm runoff is entirely consistent with the large premelt components calculated during snowmelt runoff at B1. The results of this and other runoff studies using environmental isotopes enable us to arrive at some general conclusions regarding the mechanisms of runoff generation in humid, temperate regions of the Precambrian Shield. Since pre-event components of runoff are generally greater than 50%, saturated groundwater flow must be the major runoff-generating mechanism in these environments. Hortonion overland flow, partial-area overland flow (caused by surface saturation from below by a rapidly rising water table), and subsurface storm flow (interflow), are rejected as possible dominating runoff mechanisms since they all involve discharge of mainly event water to the stream during the runoff period. Recently, Gillham (1984) and Abdul and Gillham (1984) have shown through field and laboratory experiments that the addition of even a small amount of water to the capillary fringe (the zone of tension saturation) can cause a rapid and disproportionately large rise in the water table resulting in large discharges of groundwater to streams. This capillary-fringe effect may well be an important phenomenon capable of mobilizing groundwater to stream runoff in these Shield watersheds. [&] Isotopic studies of the 1984 and 1985 snowmelt runoff periods in the Turkey Lakes watershed confirm the conclusions of earlier studies at this site (Bottomley et al., 1984) that groundwater of premelt origin is a major component of the stream runoff. In the two streams studied, 50-60% of the peak flow was contributed by groundwater recharged during the previous year or perhaps even earlier. This lag time between groundwater recharge and discharge enables the production of carbonate alkalinity below the water table through the dissolution of silicate and carbonate minerals by carbonic acid. In the shallow surficial deposits on the hillslopes, however, the rapid infiltration of the acidic 233 meltwater temporarily overwhelms the acid-neutralization capacity of these materials, resulting in shallow groundwater acidification events. Groundwater deeper than 1-2 m experiences increased hydraulic heads associated with meltwater recharge but is not influenced chemically by mixing with the meltwater during the runoff period. ;N/A;Discussion;228;Turkey Lakes watershed, Ontario, Canada;47,053208300000001;-84,403778200000005;10,500000000000000;2;Tributary;1;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;4,000000000000000;Groundwater storage, Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Water table rise, Snow storage;Sub.GW.Store, Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Surf.Snow.Stor;8,000000000000000;Capillary rise, Snowmelt, Mixing, Channel flow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Gaining stream, Infiltration, Groundwater flow;Sub.Soil.Matrix.Capil, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.Soil.Mix, Chan.Flow, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Surf.Inf.Inf, Sub.GW.Flow;1,000000000000000;N/A

The Adirondack region is almost entirely forested and is the largest state park in the United States. Repeated glaciations that last receded 10	000	years ago have left rugged terrain. Bedrock geology is a complex mixture of granitic and gneissic rocks with a variety of less common metasedimentary formations scattered throughout the region (Roy et al., 1997). Surficial deposits reflect this complexity and include highly weatherable calcareous minerals in some areas (Roy et al., 1997). Mean annual precipitation ranges from approximately 800 to over 1600	mm across the region (Ito, Mitchell, & Driscoll, 2002). Below-freezing temperatures occur through most of the winter, and with the onset of spring in late March or early April accumulated snow melts over several weeks causing high sustained streamflows.

In North Buck (area 27	ha), organic-rich soils directly overlie bedrock in all but the lowest area of the watershed where some thin till deposition has occurred. As a result, the stream is prone to becoming dry during periods in the late growing season (AugustSeptember). A wetland with a floating vegetation mat, 0.75	ha in area, occurs near the top of the watershed, adjacent to a forested area with moss-covered perennially wet soils covering an area of 0.25	ha. The forest is a mixture of hardwood and conifer species. The most abundant canopy tree is red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.), followed by red maple (Acer rubrum L.), beech, (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.). Coniferous litter contributes to a thick forest floor that averages greater than 21	cm (Oe plus Oa horizons). Soils and stream water are dominated by organic acidity that results in stream pH values that rarely exceed 4.5 (Lawrence, Scanga, & Sabo, 2020).

In South Buck (area 52	ha), till deposits play a larger hydrologic role, maintaining continuous flow even during extreme dry periods and providing acid neutralization that is well expressed during base flow. Beech is the most abundant overstory tree species, but sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.), and a few red spruce are also present in the canopy. Soils are less influenced by organic matter than North Buck but are also extremely acidic. The average forest floor thickness is less than 10 cm, which reflects hardwood litter that decomposes more readily than conifer litter. The acidic soils overlying acid-neutralizing till result in stream pH values ranging widely from 4.5 to over 6.5 with variations in streamflow (Lawrence, Scanga, & Sabo, 2020).";3;SITE DESCRIPTIONS;4;Buck Creek, New York, United States;43,743941999999997;-74,722189000000000;3,100000000000000;2;Multiple catchments;1;N;Vegetation species described;Soil described;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Soil water storage, Snow storage, Soil saturation;Sub.Soil.Store, Surf.Snow.Stor, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur;4,000000000000000;Snowmelt, Gaining stream, Perennial flow, Intermittent streamflow;Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Chan.Flow.Peren, Chan.Flow.Interm;1,000000000000000;N/A

A similar relationship was found on the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia (Reinhart et al. 1963). The relatively shallow soils do not have a large water storage capacity, and recharge occurs quickly. This lack of soil water storage space produces 'flashy' or rapid streamflow response on these watersheds. This minimal soil water storage dictates that baseflow cannot be sustained during prolonged dry periods and the streams cease flow for brief periods during the year. Low flows occur primarily in July and August, periods of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration demand. The longest period without flow was an 11 day span in late August and early September, 1975. 
A flow duration curve (figure 3), representing the 1972 - 1976 period, indicates the distribution of flows and further substantiates the flashy nature of streamflow from the area. Morisawa (1968) indicates that flow duration curves allow characterization of runoff from watersheds. Those watersheds with deep permeable soils and large water storage capacity will exhibit flat flow duration curves, whereas watersheds with little or no storage have steeply sloped curves. The curve from Falling Rock watershed has a relatively steep slope, further evidence of lack of moisture storage within the soils of Robin­son Forest.. 
Stormflows 
Stormflow or direct runoff from relatively undisturbed forested water­sheds consists primarily of subsurface flow, with little or no surface runoff in evidence. [&] July is the only month when quickflow was less than 30 percent of the mean monthly flow. During the study, quickflow averaged 44 percent of the mean annual runoff. If we assume that our streamflow measurements represent total water yield from the watershed, this 44 percent response is very high! Hewlett: and Hibhett. {1967), surveying forested watersheds in the eastern and southeastern U ;S., found very few watersheds with quickflow responses as high as Falling Rock";N/A;Results and Discussion;13;Falling Rock, Robinson Forest, Kentucky, United States;37,476044000000002;-83,137934999999999;0,880000000000000;1;N;1;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;1,000000000000000;Soil water storage;Sub.Soil.Store;7,000000000000000;Intermittent streamflow, Channel flow, Quickflow, Gaining stream, Subsurface stormflow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Evapotranspiration;Chan.Flow.Interm, Chan.Flow, Chan.Flow.Quick, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.SSFlow, Sub.Soil.Drain, Surf.ET;1,000000000000000;N/A

Early U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) research at SRRW in the 1990s extended the hydrologic legacy, applying newer isotopic and chemical approaches, and introducing biogeochemical research. Shanley et al. (1995) used water isotopes and solute chemistry to show that ice layers within snowpacks temporarily impeded meltwater infiltration. The isotopic approach combined with frozen ground measurements demonstrated that deep frost shunts meltwater directly to the stream locally (Shanley et al., 2015), but over larger scales the effect of ground frost is minimal (Shanley & Chalmers, 1999). Kendall et al. (1999) used solute chemistry of hillslope groundwater to show that hillslopes are not always well-connected to the stream, and Hjerdt (2002) extended this work to show that hillslope contributions were focused in convergent hollows. The extensive subsurface chemical database combined with stream event sampling have supported findings that subsurface, chemically evolved old water dominates the high-flow hydrograph (Porter et al., this issue; Kendall et al., 1999; McGlynn et al., 1999; Saiers et al., 2021; Sebestyen et al., 2008; Stewart et al., 2021).

The remainder of the watershed acts mainly as a reservoir during storms, and between storms it supplies base flow and maintains the wet areas that produce storm flow. Runoff from these wet areas is supplied by water escaping from the ground surface to reach the channel as overland flow and by direct precipitation onto the saturated area, which is essentially an expanded stream system. The runoff process depends on the operation of several continuous, interdependent flow systems, which though difficult to separate in the field except by detailed experiment, have very different reactions to rainfall. The most important transition between flow systems seems to be at the soil surface, when water is released from the extreme damping effect of subsurface flow. The importance of an area as a source of storm runoff, therefore, depends on its ability to produce overland flow. The area contributing overland flow is dynamic in the sense that it may vary seasonally or throughout a storm. The fluctuations of this partial area can be rationally related to topography, soils, antecedent moisture, and rainfall characteristics. Different soils of a watershed contribute most of their storm runoff by the same process, but with differing frequencies. Thus, the channel areas below WC-1, the upper end of the channel area above WC-1, much of the seep B catchment, the central concave area of the trenched hillside, and the straight trenched slope can be viewed as potential contributing areas arranged along a scale of rainfall return period at intervals of approximately 10-2, 10-1, 10 0, 10 1 to 10 2, and 10 2 to 10 3 years, respectively. Hydrographs of overland flow from these small areas reflect the hyetograph in a manner analogous to those from urban source areas. Storage and translation within the main channel system of a basin converts the effects of these hydrographs into a more familiar attenuated form. The partial area concept provides an attractive alternative to the Horton and subsurface storm flow models as the basis for a study of storm runoff production in an area such as Vermont. It also provides a point of departure for models of catchment behavior not based on infiltration theory; for a new look at such hydrologic concepts as the unit hydrograph, time of concentration and time-area diagrams; and for studies of nutrient losses from watersheds as well as sources of agricultural water pollution ";N/A;Conclusion;1310;Sleepers River, Vermont, United States;44,435335000000002;-72,038428999999994;111,000000000000000;1;N;1;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;2,000000000000000;Soil saturation, Expansion of saturated areas;Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Surf.Over.SE.Satexp;5,000000000000000;Topographic convergence, Exfiltration, Attenuation, SE flow from riparian zone, Gaining stream;Sub.SSFlow.Conv, Sub.GW.Ret.Exf, Chan.Atten, Surf.Over.SE.Rip, Sub.GWSW.Gain;1,000000000000000;N/A

With the snowmelt comes large pulses of water that is rich in dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM, respectively) and associated nutrients, which are in turn exported downstream [49], resulting in increased aquatic productivity [28] (figures 2(C), (F)). The relatively short snowmelt occurs over several days to weeks and represents <35% of export in the Kuparuk River [68]. The significance of the spring snowmelt period has been shown in other Arctic rivers, representing between 20%70% of annual carbon exports [50, 69, 70]. The spring snowmelt typically generates highly bioavailable DOM in the river network, which reflects the recent origin of the DOM from fresh litter and surficial soil horizons leaching with little previous decomposition [65] or photo-processing on the landscape or in the river [7173]. Simultaneously, frozen soil restricts the flow of water to organic horizons during snowmelt, introducing dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) into adjacent river networks [7476]. A portion of the DON may remain on site or be transformed into inorganic forms that can increase nutrient availability for terrestrial plants and soil microorganisms while some of the DON is exported downstream before mineralization to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) [77] (figure 2(C)).
As thaw progresses in the Kuparuk, biological activity and deepening water flow paths increasingly control the amount of DOM and nitrogen as DON or DIN reaching the river network and leaving it via downstream export [46] (figure 2(C)). The seasonal thickening of the active layer facilitates the movement of water through deeper mineral soil profiles where it interacts with solute-rich permafrost [16, 74, 78] (figure 2(E)). These deeper flowpaths either promote DOM leaching from detritus and above-ground plant biomass as water builds up at the soil-permafrost interface, or increase rates of decomposition and increase sorption to mineral particles [24, 79]. Newly released DOM and DIN are then exported laterally by surface or subsurface flow paths [53], potentially decreasing soil nutrient availability and altering the chemical composition of waters draining permafrost landscapes [65, 74] (figure 2(C)). As inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) become increasingly limiting as a result of biotic demand, mobilized DOM continues to fuel instream respiration [29, 80, 81]. While low temperatures experienced in the early flow season may limit carbon processing by bacterial respiration, once DOM enters into the stream channel and is moved along the aquatic continuum, it can still experience high rates of processing via photo-mineralization and some partial photo-oxidation as it is transported downstream [71, 72] (figure 2(D)). Photo-oxidation requires sunlight to reach the water column, so its influence on DOM peaks in June and decreases later in the flow season, while hillslope connectivity is still increasing via active layer thickening until late flow season [79] (figure 2(E)). Concurrently, in the late flow season, DON may be sorbed to sediment particles or mineralized to DIN, resulting in increasing lateral flux of inorganic forms of nitrogen, such as NO3 [16, 75, 77]. While late-season DOM often exhibits low bioavailability [82], the decline of photo-processing and influx in DIN may result in a brief increase of late-season heterotrophic response [77] (figure 2(G)).";1.1;What we know: seasonality of biogeochemical budgets in the Kuparuk headwaters;2;Upper Kuparuk River, Alaska, United States;68,649592999999996;-149,416193999999990;90,599999999999994;1;N;3;Season;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;4,000000000000000;Perched water tables, Permafrost storage, Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Channel storage;Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Surf.Frozen.Perm, Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Chan.Store;6,000000000000000;Overland Flow, Organic layer interflow, Lateral matrix flow, Snowmelt, Connectivity between hillslopes and channel, Subsurface stormflow;Surf.Over, Sub.SSFlow.Organ, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.GWSW.Conn.Hill, Sub.SSFlow;1,000000000000000;N/A

(a) Pre-recharge conditions: water moves slowly through the unsaturated zone, ground-water moves through the bedrock adjacent to and underlying the floodplain aquifer (alluvium), and chemically homogeneous ground water fills the saturated portion of the alluvium. (b) Recharge conditions: precipitation enters the bedrock aquifer(s) rapidly, probably through fractures. The newly recharged water displaces resident ground water in the bedrock into the alluvium, causing a relatively rapid rise in water table because of injection of more sulfate-rich water (vertical bars) from the bedrock into the base of the alluvium. The rise in water table entrains high-nitrate water (slanted bars) in the inundated part of the unsaturated zone. Unsaturated-zone water flow continues downward, but is still slow, because low hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium prevents rapid recharge. Unsaturated zone air is pushed upward out of the ground, also, as the alluvium water table rises. (c) Early post-recharge: when recharge to the bedrock ceases, the water table begins to fall as the water in the alluvium drains to the creek. The drop in the water table draws fresh atmosphere into the unsaturated zone. The water in the alluvial aquifer begins to mix. (d) Later post-recharge: as the water table continues to fall, mixing continues, and the water also now comes into equilibrium with the fresh unsaturated zone air, resulting in a pulse of oxygen in the alluvial aquifer. The oxygen levels in the alluvial-aquifer ground water decline because of microbial processes, and mixing of the alluvium ground water continues until a nearly chemically homogeneous floodplain aquifer is reestablished (a).;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0022169403003883-gr9.jpg;N/A;N/A;N/A;N/A;Konza Prairie LTER, Kansas, United States;39,103509000000003;-96,603547000000006;34,869999999999997;1;N;4;Event;Vegetation described;Soil types described;Geological types described;Slopes described;N;N;N;5,000000000000000;Groundwater storage, Bedrock fracture storage, Water table rise, Water table fall, Water Table;Sub.GW.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Matrix, Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Sub.GW.Store.Fall, Sub.GW.Store.Wtable;5,000000000000000;Groundwater flow, Vapor diffusion, Mixing, Gaining stream, Vertical drainage to groundwater;Sub.GW.Flow, Sub.Soil.Vapor, Sub.Soil.Mix, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.Soil.Drain;1,000000000000000;N/A

The 520 ha C2 reference watershed is isolated and free of any human intervention. The vegetation in CPCRW is dominated by birch and aspen on the south-facing slopes and black spruce forests on the north-facing slopes. The climate is typically continental with warm summers and cold winters. The CPCRW is unique among the watersheds in this cross-site comparison because it is underlain by discontinuous permafrost. The permafrost distribution within the watershed exerts a strong influence over hydrological patterns (Jones and Rinehart, 2010). Studies show that as the areal extent of permafrost increases, peak discharge increases, baseflow decreases and response to precipitation events increases (Bolton et al., 2004). The C2 watershed was chosen as a reference watershed because it is underlain by only about 3% permafrost compared with the adjacent C3 and C4 watersheds which are underlain by 53% and 19%, respectively.
Total mean precipitation in the C2 watershed is 412 mm, with mean snowfall and rainfall being 130 mm and 280 mm, respectively (Bolton et al., 2004). Annual maximum snow depth averages 750 mm with a snow water equivalent of 110 mm. Of the total precipitation, nearly 20% becomes streamflow while evapotranspiration makes up over 75% (Bolton et al., 2004). About 35% of the total precipitation falls as snow between October and April. Snowfall peaks around January while rainfall peaks around July. The spatial distribution of rainfall amount is influenced by elevation. The relatively flat FDC for the C2 watershed (Plates 11 and 12, Table 14.2) may be attributed to the relatively well-drained soils that allow infiltration to deeper subsurface reservoirs. Runoff is generated only when the infiltration capacity is met. Streamflow in the watershed is generated by shallow subsurface storm runoff from permafrost-dominated areas, but steady groundwater baseflows with the highest Q90 /Q50 of all the sites (Table 14.2) are produced from permafrost-free areas such as C2. Spring snowmelt is usually the major hydrological event of the year, although the annual peak flow usually occurs during summer rainstorm events, as the highest rainfall intensities are greater than the maximum snowmelt rate on a daily timescale (Kane and Hinzman, 2004). It may be noted from Fig. 14.2 that the mean monthly streamflow of C2 is relatively even over the months of April through October. During winter the gauges are mostly frozen and any flow is hardly recorded, except for relatively warm temperatures. Although rainfall peaks around July, there is an increase in mean flow from July to September due to an increase in baseflow.";14.2.1;Caribou-Poker Creek Research Watershed (CPCRW), reference sub-watershed C2, Alaska;225;C2, Caribou-Poker Creek, Alaska, United States;65,158167885243500;-147,608076042822006;5,200000000000000;2;Land use / Land cover;3;Season;Vegetation described;Soil described;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Snow storage, Soil water storage, Groundwater storage;Surf.Snow.Stor, Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.GW.Store;7,000000000000000;Infiltration, Subsurface stormflow, Evapotranspiration, Channel flow, Snowmelt, Gaining stream, Vertical drainage to groundwater;Surf.Inf.Inf, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.ET, Chan.Flow, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.Soil.Drain;1,000000000000000;N/A

Initially, the entire 473 ha NF watershed served as the reference watershed, but after portions were logged in 1985, three NF sub-watersheds (16 to 39 ha) were designated as long-term reference watersheds. Bedrock is marine sandstone and shale of the Franciscan Complex. Most soils are 12 m deep loams and clay-loams and underlain by saprolite at depths of 38 m near ridgetops. Only about one-fifth of the 4.6 km/km2 drainage density supports perennial streamflow. Timber production has been the major land use, and evidence of 19th century logging and the impacts of this legacy persist. Snow is hydrologically insignificant and 95% of rainfall occurs in OctoberApril. Fog occurs on about one-third of days in JuneSeptember, reducing summer transpiration (Keppeler, 2007). The marine influence ensures that summer air temperatures rarely exceed 20°C and winter minimums seldom drop below 0°C. Stream runoff is about half of the average annual rainfall (Reid and Lewis, 2009). Transpiration and canopy evaporation account for nearly equal portions of the remainder (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Actual evapotranspiration is limited by soil moisture deficits in MaySeptember. Analysis of climate-related trends suggests that autumn rainfall and streamflow have declined, but with no change in annual totals. The FDC for CCEW spans a wide range of streamflow compared with most of the other USDA-EFR sites (Plates 11 and 12) due to the strong seasonal pattern of large, episodic winter rain events that typically produce multiple, short-duration peak flows while extended summer droughts result in a long, slow recession for about half the year (Fig. 14.2). Summer streamflow is generated primarily from groundwater, and by autumn about 300 mm of precipitation is needed to mitigate moisture deficits sufficiently to generate stormflow. Stormflow (total flow based on difference between initial discharge at start of runoff and the discharge at 3 days following the cessation of the rainfall event) comprises about two-thirds of annual runoff (Reid and Lewis, 2009). Infiltration is rapid on uncompacted soils and vertical throughflow dominates near the surface. A deeper clay-rich argillic horizon can impede downward flow and generate lateral subsurface flow, although preferential flow through interconnected soil macropores limits pore-pressure increases and the extent of this perched flow. Perennial and intermittent soil pipes occur in the upper 2 m of the regolith and are frequently encountered near channel heads. When transient groundwater tables rise to the elevation of these pipes, they rapidly transmit subsurface flow to channels, mitigating pore-pressure increases upslope (Keppeler and Brown, 1998). Saturation-excess overland (return) flow is limited, but can occur on valley bottoms during large storms.;14.2.2;Caspar Creek Experimental Watershed (CCEW), reference watershed North Fork (NF), California;227;Casper Creek, California, United States;39,361269999999998;-123,735394999999997;4,730000000000000;1;N;2;Season;Vegetation described;Soil described;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;4,000000000000000;Groundwater storage, Water table rise, Soil stratification, Soil water storage;Sub.GW.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Sub.Soil.Store.Layer, Sub.Soil.Store;12,000000000000000;Canopy evaporation, SE flow from riparian zone, Lateral macropore flow, Vertical macropore flow, Quickflow, Infiltration, Perennial flow, Vertical matrix flow, Return Flow, Channel flow, Lateral matrix flow at soil horizons, Transpiration;Surf.ET.Evap.Canopy, Surf.Over.SE.Rip, Sub.SSFlow.Macro, Sub.Soil.Macro, Chan.Flow.Quick, Surf.Inf.Inf, Chan.Flow.Peren, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.GW.Ret, Chan.Flow, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix.Horiz, Surf.ET.Transp;1,000000000000000;N/A

It spans the subalpine to alpine zone; a zone that is characterized by relatively low temperatures and moderate precipitation (Love, 1960). The area is dominated by Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir on higher-elevation and shaded slopes, lodgepole pine on lower-elevation sunny slopes and alpine tundra above the treeline. The 803 ha ESL watershed has received no significant treatment in over 90 years (Retzer, 1962). Precipitation is dominated heavily by snowfall (about 75%) from October through May (Alexander et al., 1985) and runoff is dominated by snowmelt (about 90%) from May through August (Fig. 14.2). Significant summertime convective rainfall events may also temporarily increase flow. The main stem is perennial but baseflow is low, stable and unmeasured during the winter months due to logistical difficulties of stream measurements in winter. The runoff coefficient for annual flow is about 45% with significant wintertime sublimation losses from the canopy and summertime evapotranspiration. Summertime rainfall is primarily used on site by vegetation, with high evaporative losses due to dry air masses and wind. High-elevation stream reaches are intermittent with spring and summertime flows fed by snowmelt (Fig. 14.2). The hydrological regime is dominated by a typical seasonal snowmelt hydrograph with a rapid rising limb in May and June, followed by a long recession, returning to baseflow (second largest Q90/Q50 , Table 14.2) in August (Alexander et al., 1985; Troendle and King, 1985). Extensive spring networks feed the drainage systems as the annual snowmelt pulse moves through the basin (Retzer, 1962). Rainfall events punctuate the snowmelt hydrograph, but contribute insignificant amounts to the annual runoff. Infiltration-excess overland flow is rare, but may occur under the snowpack during the melt season when frozen ground impedes infiltration. Saturation-excess overland flow is extremely rare as infiltration rates for the porous soils and glacial till typically exceed maximum rainfall and snowmelt rates (Retzer, 1962). The ESL represents the highest elevation range, largest snowpack and largest watershed of this cross-site comparison. Maximum snowmelt rates are limited by incoming energy and can never reach extreme rainfall rates. Rain-on-snow flood events can alter flow statistics, but are rare in this portion of the Rockies. The relatively large size of the basin also reduces flashy response or high runoff per unit area observed in smaller basins.";14.2.5;Fraser Experimental Forest (FrEF), reference watershed East St Louis (ESL), Colorado;228;Fraser, Colorado, United States;39,890785999999999;-105,877297999999996;8,029999999999999;2;Hillslope position;3;Season;Vegetation described;Soil described;N;N;N;N;N;1,000000000000000;Snow storage;Surf.Snow.Stor;9,000000000000000;Evapotranspiration, Perennial flow, Canopy sublimation, Gaining stream, Snowmelt, Saturation excess flow, Intermittent streamflow, Springflow, IE flow from frozen ground;Surf.ET, Chan.Flow.Peren, Surf.Snow.Subl.Canopy, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Surf.Snow.Melt, Surf.Over.SE, Chan.Flow.Interm, Sub.GW.Ret.Spr, Surf.Over.IE.Frozen;1,000000000000000;N/A

Watershed 2 (WS02) is 60 ha and the geology is dominated by bedrock of volcanic origin. Stream channels are steep and confined with unsorted sediment dominated by cobbles and boulders, with patches of silt and exposed bedrock. Shallow hillslope soils (generally less than 1 m deep) are loam and clay loam. Stone content ranges from 35 to 80%, increasing on south-facing slopes. The steep hillslopes in WS02 are dominated by 500- to 550-year-old Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga mensiesii) forests with western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) (Rothacher et al., 1967). The canopy is greater than 60 m tall. The climate is continental with cold winters and cool, short, dry summers. Annual precipitation averages 2300 mm, falling primarily as rain between  November and April and with occasional snow at higher elevations. Soil temperatures remain above freezing. The annual hydrograph in WS02 has a strong seasonal pattern with a high winter baseflow and frequent autumn, winter and spring stormflows in contrast to very low flows in summer (Fig. 14.3). Approximately 57% of the precipitation is streamflow (Post and Jones, 2001). Baseflow accounts for only 43% of the discharge (Q90/Q50 = 0.126) (Table 14.2) whereas quickflow comprises the remainder (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). McGuire et al. (2005) estimated that mean baseflow residence time for WS02, based on ´O18 of water, was approximately 2.2 years. They suggested that topography and steepness may be exerting greater control on residence times than watershed area. Although there are no detectable trends in streamflow from 1987 to 2007, in more recent time periods (19962007) slight decreasing trends have been observed (Argerich et al., 2013). The relatively steep FDC for WS02 (Plates 11 and 12) has been attributed to highly permeable soils and strong seasonal precipitation patterns. Fast percolation rates, typically greater than 0.12 m/h, are influenced by high stone content and large pore spaces (Rothacher et al., 1967). These  characteristics also lead to substantial hyporheic flows lateral to and beneath the streams (Kasahara and Wondzell, 2003).;14.2.6;H.J.

Chaparral forest is a dense, drought-tolerant shrubland with a closed canopy some 35 m in height. Chaparral is a fire-prone ecosystem and wildfires have burned the SDEF about every 40 years. Regional hydrology is controlled by climate and geology: cool, wet winters followed by long summer droughts; and ongoing tectonic uplift that has produced steep topography and exposed fractured crystalline basement rocks that weather to thin, coarse-textured, azonal soils (Dunn et al., 1988) (Table 14.1). Precipitation falls almost exclusively as rain from winter frontal storms and rare summer thunderstorms. Nearly 90% of the annual rainfall occurs between December and April with the most runoff in February (Fig. 14.2). Streamflow accounts for only roughly 11% of the rainfall, with the remainder apportioned to evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Groundwater dynamics on the SDEF are virtually unknown, rendering the closure of any water balance exercise moot. However, groundwater recharge is potentially large through the fractured substrate, reducing any calculated value of actual evapotranspiration. Soil moisture is at or below the wilting point by the end of the summer and the drought-adapted plants likely get their water from fractures in the bedrock. Stream runoff is generated by saturation excess flow in riparian zones, presumably as shallow throughflow moves laterally through the coarse soil mantle (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Infiltration-excess overland flow on hillside slopes is rare and occurs only during the most intense rainstorms, reflecting the high infiltration rates of the soil and percolation into bedrock. However, after wildfire, with the combustion of the canopy and surface litter layer as well as changes in soil properties (bulk density and water repellency), hillslope hydrology shifts to pervasive overland flow after saturation of the very thin surface wettable layer (Rice, 1974; DeBano, 1981). Water that formerly slowly flowed by subsurface pathways now moves quickly into the stream channels, increasing runoff for comparable storms by up to four orders of magnitude over pre-fire levels (Wohlgemuth, 2016). The effects of fire on the forest hydrology can persist for several years.";14.2.9;San Dimas Experimental Forest (SDEF), reference watershed Bell 3, California;231;San Dimas, California, United States;34,200000000000003;-117,780000000000001;0,250000000000000;1;N;2;Season;Vegetation described;Soil described;Geological types described;Slopes described;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Hydrophobicity, Bedrock fracture storage, Soil water storage;Surf.Inf.Soil.Hyphob, Sub.GW.Store.Matrix, Sub.Soil.Store;10,000000000000000;Lateral matrix flow, Quickflow, Infiltration excess flow, SE flow from riparian zone, Evapotranspiration, Infiltration into bedrock, Channel flow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Overland Flow, Infiltration;Sub.SSFlow.Matrix, Chan.Flow.Quick, Surf.Over.IE, Surf.Over.SE.Rip, Surf.ET, Sub.GW.BedInf, Chan.Flow, Sub.Soil.Drain, Surf.Over, Surf.Inf.Inf;1,000000000000000;N/A

Under nonsteady wetting conditions, water is mobilized in the soil, but this water is dominantly old water. We did not see evidence for preferential flow of new water under either the steady low-intensity conditions of our sprinkling experiments or in two natural storms. Flow in the saturated zone at the base of the colluvium is rapid and, taking advantage of exfoliation fractures, crosses back and forth between rock and colluvium in the zone of convergent topography (of both the surface and the bedrock/ colluvium interface) down the axis of the catchment. The area of subsurface saturation in the colluvium near the channel head expands and contracts during storm events and, in so doing, exerts important control on the flow paths contributing runoff. Water percolating through the vadose zone in the colluvium mixes in this saturated area with water emerging from the bedrock. The bedrock flow path predominates under all flow conditions, but when the area of saturation near the weir grows both in areal extent and thickness during a  storm, an increasing proportion of runoff is derived from vertical percolation through colluvium above this area. As Hewlett and Hibbert [1967] predicted in their conceptual model, we see a greater contribution to storm runoff from the colluvium near the channel, while other parts of the slope contribute a higher proportion of base flow runoff. Moreover, the timing of generation of runoff does not appear to be tied to the rate at which water moves through the catchment. We believe that this type of subsurface variable source area is likely to be important in runoff generation and stream chemistry of other steep lands with shallow soils overlying fractured bedrock.;6;Conclusions;2650;CB1, Coos Bay, Oregon, United States;43,464186099999999;-124,112416199999998;0,000860000000000;1;N;1;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Soil water storage, Bedrock fracture storage, Perched water tables;Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Matrix, Sub.GW.Store.Perch;7,000000000000000;Vertical drainage to groundwater, Vertical matrix flow, Groundwater flow, Variable source area - subsurface stormflow, Lateral matrix flow at soil-bedrock interface, Gaining stream, Topographic convergence;Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.GW.Flow, Sub.SSFlow.VSAsub, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix.Bedrk, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.SSFlow.Conv;1,000000000000000;N/A

In early spring, melt from the general snow-covered area causes a groundwater rise throughout the monitored area. Once the general snowcover is gone, snowmelt from the isolated drift drives the hydraulic response of the piezometers, with piezometers further upslope and closer to the drift responding to melt events sooner than piezometers near the bottom of the slope. Response time of piezometers to snowmelt from the isolated drift was found to differ dramatically between two years that had different snow accumulation. During a year with near-normal snow accumulation, response time between piezometers near the toe of the drift and those near the stream channel 70-140 m downslope was approximately 2-3 days. Response time was 32-46 days during a year with snow accumulation approximately 40% of normal. Most of the saturated flow through the hillslope occurs in an altered basalt layer lying between two layers of dense basalt. Based on slug tests conducted by Winkelmaier (1987), hydraulic conductivity of the altered basalt layer is approximately 5x10-4 cms-1 . Assuming the porosity of this layer is 1-5% and given a 20% slope, it would take 15-78 days for water to travel the 135 m between piezometers K7 and G5. This travel time is considerably greater than the 1986 response lag times, but, given the rough approximations, is of the order of travel times observed during the 1987 melt. A conceptual model was hypothesized to explain the large differences in response times between 1986 to 1987. Figure 8 shows the estimated height of the water table in relation to the hydrogeologic zones within a hillslope cross-section. Recharge from the general snowmelt in 1986 was sufficient to fill the altered basalt layer. The overlying semi-dense basalt layer then acted as a confining layer for groundwater flow. Meltwater from the snowdrift entered the altered basalt layer (zone 4) upslope from the semi-dense basalt layer. Excess water formed perched water tables above the semi-dense basalt layer as indicated by piezometers at I6. The rapid response during 1986 was therefore primarily a pressure pulse through the altered basalt layer. Had the semi-dense basalt layer been completely impermeable, response times would be extremely rapid. The conceptual model is further supported by the rapid rise and fall in the piezometers when the water level was above the semi-dense basalt layer, and slow recession when the water level fell below the semi-dense basalt layer (at an elevation of 1890.9 m at K7 in Fig. 4(b)). Because recharge during 1987 was insufficient to fill the altered basalt zone (Fig. 8), response time between piezometers was due to water movement through the system and is indicative of travel time in the zero-order basin.;N/A;Discussion and Conclusions;307;Upper Sheep Creek, Reynolds Creek, Idaho, United States;43,122999999999998;-116,724999999999994;0,260000000000000;1;N;4;Season;N;N;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;5,000000000000000;Snow storage, Soil stratification, Perched water tables, Water table rise, Snow storage;Surf.Snow.Stor, Sub.Soil.Store.Layer, Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Surf.Snow.Stor;4,000000000000000;Groundwater flow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Displacement of groundwater, Snowmelt;Sub.GW.Flow, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.GW.Disp, Surf.Snow.Melt;1,000000000000000;N/A

Flerchinger et al. (1992) found that the response time of piezometers to snowmelt from the isolated drift differed quite dramatically depending on the extent of recharge from snowmelt. During years with near-normal snow accumulation, the response time between piezometers near the toe of the drift and those near the stream channel 70-140 m downslope was approximately 2-3 days. The response time was 32-42 days during a year with snow accumulation approximately 40% of normal. Flerchinger et al. (1992) hypothesized a conceptual model to explain the large differences in response times. Recharge from the general snowmelt during years with normal snow accumulation is sufficient to fill the altered basalt layer (zone 4 in Fig. 2), causing the flow to become confined between the dense and semi-dense basalt layers (zones 5 and 3, respectively). The rapid response is therefore primarily a pressure pulse through the altered basalt layer as melt water enters the altered basalt layer (zone 4) upslope from where the semi-dense layer exists. Slower response during years with low snow accumulation results from water movement through the system, and is indicative of travel time through the altered basalt layer.;N/A;Conceptual model;204;Upper Sheep Creek, Reynolds Creek, Idaho, United States;43,122999999999998;-116,724999999999994;0,260000000000000;1;N;4;Season;N;N;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;5,000000000000000;Snow storage, Perched water tables, Soil stratification, Snow storage, Water table rise;Surf.Snow.Stor, Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Sub.Soil.Store.Layer, Surf.Snow.Stor, Sub.GW.Store.Rise;4,000000000000000;Vertical drainage to groundwater, Groundwater flow, Snowmelt, Displacement of groundwater;Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.GW.Flow, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.GW.Disp;1,000000000000000;N/A

We do have evidence, however, that the very shallow highly fractured bedrock in and around the soilbedrock interface does exert an influence on runoff processes and contributes directly to lateral subsurface stormflow. We hypothesize that once subsurface stormflow occurs, some portion of the flow is lost as seepage to the fractured bedrock. Once in the bedrock, circulation is controlled by the fracture network density, geometry and connectivity (Banks et al., 2009) and is extremely heterogeneous. Well dynamics shown in Fig. 3b provides evidence of differing flow paths within the fractured bedrock as the water table response between wells are highly variable despite their close proximity. Some flow follows deeper fracture pathways connecting to a deeper bedrock aquifer. This seepage does not play a direct role in the storm event runoff, but instead follows classic groundwater discharge pathways that maintain baseflow conditions (Winter, 2007). Subsurface stormflow that follows shallow bedrock fracture pathways may either remerge at the soil bedrock interface if the fracture pinches out, or may directly bypass to the stream channel depending on the fracture network. In both cases, this water has a direct contribution to storm runoff. Graham et al. (2010a) showed that near surface fractured bedrock constituted a significant flow path in the WS10 hillslope, nearly equal in volume to subsurface lateral flow in the soil during a sprinkler experiment that brought the WS10 instrumented hillslope up to steady state discharge. Highly fractured regions of bedrock can act to either prevent saturation due to highly transmissive fractures that transport water rapidly downslope, or augment saturation at the soil bedrock interface by acting as an exfiltration zone which transports and concentrates water from upslope regions to downslope regions. Similar findings have been reported by others. For example, Uchida et al. (2002) determined that exfiltrating bedrock groundwater was an important contributor to transient groundwater in upper hillslope regions in a zero-order catchment in Central Japan. Wilson and Dietrich (1987) noted that bedrock return flow occurred where fractured bedrock encountered a competent zone that forced flow back up into the subsoil, creating a transient saturated zone. Montgomery et al. (2002) and Anderson et al. (1997) found that return flow from bedrock created zones of transient saturation at the soil bedrock interface, and deeper bedrock pathways carried tracers rapidly through the subsurface to the channel head. Considering the heterogeneity of fractured bedrock, it is possible to conceive of a patchy network of saturated zones in upslope regions that are in part, controlled by the underlying bedrock. Saturated zones would occur on top of more competent regions, while unsaturated zone would occur over fractured regions. The hillslope would then display variably saturated conditions depending on rainfall amount, intensity, and antecedent conditions, similar to what both Harr (1977) and McGuire and McDonnell (2010) reported. The isotope time series (Fig. 6b) shows Well B4, the trench and the stream all shifting away from the rain input signal towards lighter isotopic values immediately prior to the hydrograph peak. Although we cannot directly identify the water source that is causing this shift (although we hypothesize that it is unmeasured soil water/vadose water end member), we are able to rule out event water as the source of water into the bedrock.;5.1.2;H.J.

Studies of runoff generation in interior Alaska (Dingman 1971, 1973, Kane et al. 1981 ) suggest that the extent of permafrost exerts a strong control on the open-water-season hydrologic response of small watersheds. Kane et al. (1981) studied the differences in runoff processes between permafrost-underlain and permafrost-free soils in Glenn Creek and found that permafrost underlain soils contributed the major portion of spring runoff. During winter the organic layer over these soils provides a moisture supply for vertical transport upward to the snowpack, increasing its water equivalent. The organic mat becomes dessicated over the winter, so during snowmelt, water from the snowpack may be used to satisfy its moisture deficit instead of becoming runoff (Santeford 1978, Slaughter and Kane 1978, Kane et al. 1981). In permafrost areas the poorly drained mineral soils under this mat often cause ice-rich conditions to develop in the vicinity of streams and valley bottoms. The ice restricts drainage, so that once the organic mat moisture deficit is satisfied, water in these areas moves downslope through the mat to the stream. On the other hand, soils in permafrost-free areas are moderately well drained (even when frozen), so water can infiltrate them once the organic mat moisture deficit has been satisfied. No overland flow will occur until the infiltration capacity of these soils is exceeded. Kane et al. (1981) observed no overland flow on permafrost-free, south-facing slopes, indicating that this rarely occurs (Dingman 1971). As a result, permafrost-free soils contribute little to runoff during snowpack ablation. [...] Thus, most of the differences in response between C-2 and C-3 appear to be attributable to the percentage of permafrost in the two watersheds. The plots of the data for Glenn Creek, with 68.5% permafrost, are essentially parallel to those for C-3, in spite of the considerably lower relief ratio and drainage density of Glenn Creek. Response differences between C-2 and C-3 indicate that the variable-source-area process may be operating as suggested by Dingman(1971) for Glenn Creek. If so, the restricted drainage due to permafrost results in more wide-spread saturated and nearly saturated zones and thus more overland flow in C-3, as reflected in Figure 14. To the extent that Hortonian overland flow occurs, the more widespread poorly drained soils in C-3 may also result in more overland flow to the channel. The widespread permafrost on slopes and beneath the channel in C-3 may result in much smaller groundwater contributions and lower base flows than in C-2, as shown in Figure 14. [...] This analysis suggests that the hydrologic response of small watersheds in central Alaska is strongly controlled by permafrost. When permafrost underlies a significant portion of a watershed and is present beneath most stream channels, the streanflow peaks in response to rainstorms will be relatively high, and the base flows between storms will be relatively low. Watersheds with little permafrost will have lower peaks and higher sustained base flows per unit area.;N/A;Spatial flow variability;19;C1-3, Caribou-Poker, Alaska, United States;65,149176999999995;-147,552332000000007;41,700000000000003;2;Land use / Land cover;2;Season;N;Soil types described;N;Topography described;N;Uncertainty described;N;2,000000000000000;Expansion of saturated areas, Snow storage;Surf.Over.SE.Satexp, Surf.Snow.Stor;6,000000000000000;Infiltration, Saturation excess flow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Lateral macropore flow at soil horizons, Snowmelt, Soil surface evaporation;Surf.Inf.Inf, Surf.Over.SE, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.SSFlow.Macro.Horiz, Surf.Snow.Melt, Surf.ET.Evap.Soil;1,000000000000000;N/A

5.2.1 Spring Snowmelt Runoff Over Frozen Soils
Spring runoff was dominated by the precipitation and organic components (Figure 8) with a depleted isotopic signature similar to the winter flow end-member (Table 4 and Figure 6). Given that active layers are shallow in May (Figure 3a), soil storage potential is limited and water reaches the stream quickly [Roulet and Woo, 1986]. The precipitation signature indicates that runoff was unable to leach material from catchment soils. This runoff could have originated from the burned slope where organics are minimal and mineral soils are still frozen, and/or it could indicate water moving through organic soil pipes. Such pipes transport water rapidly, limit water-soil interactions relative to overland flow or throughflow, and are an important runoff mechanism in organic boreal soils in the early summer [Carey and Woo, 2000]. Spring runoff also contains organic-rich water, indicating that this runoff is leaching material from the shallow organic soils that have already thawed. In the spring, the large aufeis features in the riparian area are thawing, suggesting that much of the early-summer organic flow may be related to aufeis melt leaching organic material from the woody shrubs that dominate the riparian zone. [...]
5.2.2 Summer Base flow From a Small Aquifer in Coarse, Upper Catchment Soils
Mineral base flow was small to absent in early May, but increased toward mid-summer and dominated during inter-storm periods (Figure 8). The upper catchment contains sparser vegetation, a thinner loess cap [Kelsey et al., 2012], and coarser mineral soils, which are often associated with greater active layer depths, overall less permafrost extent and quicker soil drainage [Jorgenson et al., 2013]. Such conditions may contribute to the development of a thicker subsurface aquifer capable of storing water on longer time scales and producing a mineral-rich base flow component to the stream hydrograph (Figure 10a). The appearance of the mineral base flow signature in late-May to early-June may indicate that the active layer has deepened into the mineral soils at this time, allowing storage and drainage of deeper soil areas; on 2 June 2010, the mean thaw depth was 24 cm (Figure 3a), which is just deeper than the mean organic-mineral boundary determined from soil coring (mean	=	23 cm, Table 3).
The mineral base flow hydrology and chemistry is inconsistent with an older, regional water flow source. The base flow discharge is buffered from individual storm events, but it does respond to variations in seasonal and interannual water availability (Figure 8), suggesting that the aquifer drainage/flow paths are relatively short and likely not regionally controlled. Furthermore, the mineral base flow chemistry is indistinguishable from mineral runoff, which again implies similar flow path lengths between base flow and runoff and is inconsistent with altered isotopic values and elevated mineral concentrations that might be expected with longer, deeper flow paths and regional flow. [...]
5.2.3 Combined Fill and Spill and Preferential Flow Control Storm Runoff
Runoff events were generally characterized by sharp peaks that elevated both organic and mineral-rich stream chemistry (Figure 8). The flashiness of storm events indicates that runoff reaches the stream rapidly, which is inconsistent with substantial interaction between runoff and the riparian area. Runoff from the hillslopes may bypass the riparian soils by moving as overland flow on top of the impermeable riparian duff or through the ephemeral anabranches. The organic signal in runoff events was expected given that organic soils promote quick flow (Figure 3b and Table 2) and make up a large proportion of the catchment. During mid to late summer, mineral runoff reaches the stream on the same time scale as organic runoff (Figure 8) despite its lower permeability (Figure 3b). Differences in the duration of mineral and organic runoff suggest that they are decoupled, which could be explained by organic runoff originating on unburned slopes, and mineral runoff originating on burned slopes.
The rapidity with which mineral runoff reaches the stream may be related to changes in the dominant runoff mechanism after a fire. In the organic soil infiltration tests, water infiltrated vertically and only moved laterally once it reached the organic-mineral boundary (Table 2), consistent with the fill and spill concept, which has been shown to control runoff in peat-covered permafrost terrain [Carey and Woo, 2002; Wright et al., 2009]. How much organic throughflow reaches the stream may be limited by the subsurface topography (Figure 5), and multiple subsurface basins that must be filled before the water may continue downslope (Figure 10b). 
[...]
5.2.4 Slower Supra-Permafrost Drainage
Soil drainage over monthly time scales may occur due to deep drainage network beneath the unburned soils (dashed arrows in Figure 10c) rather than to the fill and spill that controls shallow organic soil runoff (solid arrows in Figure 10c). Throughflow experiments indicated that a substantial fraction of infiltrating water may move into the deeper mineral soils, especially in unburned soils (Table 3). This water may be stored in mineral soils and released back to the atmosphere as a result of the substantial evapotranspiration potential in interior boreal catchments [Bolton et al., 2004], or it may eventually reach the stream after traveling through deeper, less permeable flow paths. There were no significant isotopic variations in summer stream water even during storms (Figure 6), implying limited interaction between runoff and water stored in the catchment over longer time scales. The importance of drainage through longer flow paths is supported by the presence of isotopically depleted, high EC, high DOC aufeis that builds up in the riparian area over the winter months. Similar to previous findings, these aufeis features played a limited role in the stream water budget [Reedyk et al., 1995], but are an important indicator of slower drainage and could be more important for mobilizing organic matter from the riparian area as they thaw.
Deep subsurface gullies found at approximately 150 m spacing on the unburned slopes (Figure 5a) and beneath a consistently wet area (Figure 5b) hint at areas of preferential drainage at the frozen-unfrozen boundary. These deeper active layer gullies could form through thermal erosion as water and heat move along the frozen-unfrozen boundary. Heat advection has been recognized as an important mechanism for thawing frozen ground in other boreal catchments underlain by permafrost, leading to the development of taliks [McKenzie et al., 2007; Rowland et al., 2011], near-stream thaw bulbs [Brosten et al., 2006], and subsurface preferential flow paths [Cozzetto et al., 2013]. Given that deeper soils tend to be less permeable (Figure 3b), this water would reach the stream well after its infiltration into the hillslope, which is consistent with the observed aufeis, formed by water that reaches the stream months after recharge by spring snowmelt and summer rains. Longer catchment residence times are also consistent with the aufeis chemistry (Table 4): depleted ´18O suggests that this water was subject to fractionation potentially related to evapotranspiration, and high EC and DOC indicates that this water has had substantial (ie. longer duration) contact with both organic and mineral soils as it moves to the stream.";5.2;Catchment Runoff Mechanisms;8154;West Twin Creek, Nome Creek Watershed, Alaska, United States;65,340170000000001;-146,915462999999988;4,100000000000000;4;Hillslope position/Catchment spatial scale;9;Season and event;Shrubland described;Soil types described;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;4,000000000000000;Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Soil water storage, Permafrost storage, Groundwater storage;Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.Soil.Store, Surf.Frozen.Perm, Sub.GW.Store;13,000000000000000;Lateral macropore flow, Quickflow, Vertical macropore flow, IE flow from frozen ground, Groundwater flow, Subsurface stormflow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Snowmelt, Infiltration, Ephemeral streamflow, IE flow from impermeable areas, Gaining stream, Groundwater flooding;Sub.SSFlow.Macro, Chan.Flow.Quick, Sub.Soil.Macro, Surf.Over.IE.Frozen, Sub.GW.Flow, Sub.SSFlow, Sub.Soil.Drain, Surf.Snow.Melt, Surf.Inf.Inf, Chan.Flow.Ephem, Surf.Over.IE.Imp, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.GW.Ret.Flood;1,000000000000000;N/A

The headwater catchment was dominated by subsurface flow, consistent with our previous study at two headwater catchments in Valles Caldera, i.e. Redondo Creek and La Jara Creek catchments (15 and 4 km 2 , respectively, Liu et al., 2005). With an increase in drainage area downstream, the streamflow pathways become more  heterogeneous, with significant contributions of groundwater and near-surface runoff directly generated from snowmelt and monsoonal rainfall. This change is caused by the differences in distribution of soils along elevations. Higher elevations have deep and well-drained soil subunits of Mirand Alanos complexes, Redondo-Rubble land associations, Redondo coarse sandy loams, Redondo cobbly coarse sandy loams
and Calaveras loams (Muldavin and Tonne, 2003). Information at a 1-m soil pit excavated at 3018 m indicates that three horizons were identified: O (015 cm), A (1055 cm) and C (55100 cm), with sandy clay loam, sandy loam and loamy sand, respectively (unpublished data, Fred Phillips and John Wilson, 2004). Two types of roots were observed: grass roots within the upper 10 cm and woody roots of the ponderosa pines at the 2040 cm depth. The well-drained soils at higher elevations facilitate infiltration of snowmelt and rainwater and prevent the occurrence of near-surface runoff. When the infiltration encounters bedrock or materials with lower hydraulic conductivity, subsurface flow occurs laterally (e.g. Newman et al., 1997, 1998; Wilcox et al., 1997). A field observation shows that lateral subsurface flow generates from shallow soils at higher elevations (Figure 9(a)). Areas along valley bottoms and streams are typically clay-rich, poorly drained vertisols or mollisols developed in alluvial and fan deposits (Muldavin and Tonne, 2003). These soils are fine-textured, ranging from clay to loam, ith well-developed organic horizons and few rock fragments. Due to low hydraulic conductivity, these soils facilitate the occurrence of infiltration-excess and saturation overland flow (together termed as near-surface runoff in this study). Figure 9(b) documents the occurrence of this flow along streams in the valley at the East Fork 
Jemez River. Ring fractures are hydrogeologically well developed at lower elevations, particularly on the northwestern side of Valles Caldera (Figure 1; (Goff and Gardner, 1994)). The ring fractures function as conduits to convey groundwater (Goff and Grigsby, 1982). The extensive, hydrogeologically active ring fractures in the northwestern Caldera explain why the relative contribution of groundwater is much higher at the San Antonio West catchment than at the East Fork Jemez River catchment (Figure 8). Flowpaths in snowmelt versus monsoon season A significant difference in flowpaths between the snowmelt and monsoon seasons is the higher relative contribution of near-surface runoff during spring snowmelt than summer monsoon (Figure 8). The contribution of near-surface runoff at the East Fork Jemez River was significant during the monsoon season only when there were significant rainfall events on consecutive days. The relative contribution of near-surface runoff was almost zero throughout the monsoon season at San Antonio West, even with the frequent and high-intensity rainfall events during AugustSeptember 2006 (Figure 8(a)), which was the wettest monsoon season on record in the southwestern USA (Lyon et al., this issue). Floods did occur after each intensive monsoon rainfall event, particularly in the fall of 2006, based on the observations of Vivoni et al. (this issue). However, the variability of daily mean reciprocal conductivity values was much suppressed during the monsoon season, except for 2 days on 4 and 5 August 2006 (Figure 8). This suppression suggests that the floods caused by monsoon rainfall are flashy and may last only hours, rather than days. Soil moisture was indeed lower and more variable during the monsoon season than the snowmelt period except for 2006 (Figure 4). Soil moisture was even more variable in top soils (<6 cm) than that measured 10 cm below during the monsoon season (Vivoni et al., this issue). Transpiration of trees such as juniper and mixed conifer in Valles Caldera is limited by temperature and soil water availability (McDowell et al., this issue). Photosynthetic activity of vascular plants generally increases following relatively large precipitation pulses or a series of small precipitation pulses (Huxman et al., 2004). All these observations indicate that vegetation dictates the generation of near-surface runoff during the monsoon season through evapotranspiration (ET). Both wetland and grassland plant species flourish during the monsoon season and occupy large areas of the low-lying valleys and along streams, in which near-surface runoff usually occurs during the snowmelt period (Figure 9(b)). While strong ET consumes soil moisture, the flourishing plants increase retention time of rainwater by trapping water and thus increase infiltration of rainwater. These two factors together dampen the magnitude of near-surface runoff contributions to streams during the monsoon season.";N/A;Discussion: Headwaters versus large catchments, Flowpaths in snowmelt versus monsoon season;248;Valles Caldera, Jemez, New Mexico, United States;35,829198300000002;-106,642505400000005;349,000000000000000;6;Hillslope position/Catchment spatial scale;4;Season with snow;Multiple land-covers described;Multiple properties described;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;1,000000000000000;Soil water storage;Sub.Soil.Store;12,000000000000000;Subsurface stormflow, Pistonflow, Gaining stream, Lateral matrix flow at soil-bedrock interface, Snowmelt, Gaining stream, Transpiration, Saturation excess flow, Overland Flow, Infiltration, Evapotranspiration, Infiltration excess flow;Sub.SSFlow, Sub.GW.Disp.Piston, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix.Bedrk, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Surf.ET.Transp, Surf.Over.SE, Surf.Over, Surf.Inf.Inf, Surf.ET, Surf.Over.IE;1,000000000000000;N/A

Stage 2 is from day 156 to 200 (early June to mid-July), including a steeply rising limb in late spring to maximum discharge in early summer. Stage 3 spans from day 201 to about 270 (mid-July to late September), representing the main recession limb of hydrograph.
5.3.1.1. Stage 1
[54] Snowmelt occurs primarily in the near-channel portion of the lower watershed, where snowpack is relatively shallow. A portion of the first fraction of meltwater from the snowpack infiltrates soils and unconsolidated materials (Figure 9). The infiltrating snowmelt increases soil moistures and undergoes rapid kinetic reactions with subsurface materials [Williams et al., 1993; Mast et al., 1995; Campbell et al., 1995; Sueker et al., 2000]. Additionally, a portion of this snowmelt appears to flow directly into the stream channel, consistent with results of Campbell et al. [2002]. Solute concentrations in the stream channel increase in part because of the release of solutes from the seasonal snowpack in the form of an ionic pulse. The ionic pulse, in combination with low discharge, may explain why solute concentrations in streamflow are relatively high (Figure 2) when new water component contributes near 100% during this stage (Figure 5a).
5.3.1.2. Stage 2
[55] Snowmelt dramatically intensifies and streamflow discharge rapidly increases (Figure 2c). Soils become saturated and saturation-excess overland flow occurs near the stream channels [Williams et al., 1993]. Depression of solute concentration in this stage (Figure 2) may be a result of dilution of solute contents in subsurface flow (5060%) by surface flow (4050%) (Figure 8a). Complicating this interpretation is the potential role of seasonally frozen ground. The presence of seasonally frozen ground below the snow cover may reduce infiltration and facilitate surface flow. The potential role of seasonally frozen ground in the hydrology of high mountain catchments of the Colorado Front Range deserves more research [Clow et al., 2003].
[56] Subsurface event water primarily occurs during this stage (Figures 5a and 8a). Delivery of subsurface event water may be rapid [Wels et al., 1991a, 1991b; Brown et al., 1999], probably within an hour at the Martinelli catchment [Caine, 1989]. This water may be routed directly to the stream channels in the form of lateral flow as a thin saturated layer above the saturated zone [Wels et al., 1991a, 1991b; Brown et al., 1999]. This water can also reach to bedrock and soil interface via vertical preferential pathways [Buttle and McDonnell, 2002], mix with old water in vadose zone and saturated zone [Buttle, 1994], and rapidly travel to stream channel with old water [McDonnell, 1990]. It is unclear at this time whether preferential pathways exist at the Martinelli catchment. To confirm which mechanism predominates, hydrograph separation alone appears to be insufficient [Buttle and Peters, 1997] and physical measurements may be needed in the future.
5.3.1.3. Stage 3
[57] Streamflow behaves in a typical recession pattern. A mixture of new water and old water dominates the first 30 days after which old water dominates at base flow conditions (Figure 5a). Base flow is assumed to be primarily released from the storage in fractured bedrock (Figure 9).

Stage 1 is from the initiation of snowmelt to about day 155 (mid-May to early June), during which snowmelt is initiated and streamflow discharge is low (Figures 8a and 8b). Stage 2 is from day 156 to 200 (early June to mid-July), including a steeply rising limb in late spring to maximum discharge in early summer. Stage 3 spans from day 201 to about 270 (mid-July to late September), representing the main recession limb of hydrograph.
5.3.2.1. Stage 1
[58] Similar to the Martinelli catchment, meltwater may primarily infiltrate the ground during this stage (Figure 9). Different from the Martinelli catchment, soil water on hillslopes does not appear to contribute to streamflow. Base flow and old water may be primarily from fractured bedrock.
5.3.2.2. Stage 2
[59] Surface flow accounts for approximately 40% of streamflow (Figure 8b). Solute contents in subsurface flow are diluted by surface flow, resulting in depression of solute contents in streamflow (Figure 2). Water bodies occupy only 4% of the basin area [Meixner et al., 2000]. Direct melt on lake and stream surface is insufficient to account for surface flow. Surface flow may occur primarily in the form of saturation-excess overland flow on soils near lakes and between lake 4 and lake 5 (Figure 1). As snowmelt rate increases, saturated areas in soils may expand and thus surface flow increases.
[60] Base flow peaks during the high-flow period at the GL4 catchment (Figure 7d), along with old water (Figure 5b). Subsurface flow matches old water in magnitude and in temporal pattern. Old water appears to be delivered via translatory flow, which is stored in the groundwater reservoir and released via a lateral through flow by a process of displacement by new water inputs [Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967; Buttle, 1994; McGlynn et al., 2002]. Sklash et al. [1986] indicates that translatory flow in the near-stream zone is considered to be responsible for the large (>75%) contribution of preevent water to storm flow from the Maimai catchment in New Zealand. McDonnell et al. [1991] provide further evidence through tensiometric measurements that the near-stream zone is often close to or at saturation.
[61] Talus water is also a major contributor to the streamflow during this stage (Figure 7d). Burns et al. [2001] show that runoff from an outcrop of the forested Panola Mountain Research Watershed contributes more than 50% of the peak storm flow during two rainstorms. Similar to their results, our results demonstrate that the unique geographical setting of talus fields is important in controlling streamflow quantity and quality.
5.3.2.3. Stage 3
[62] Talus water continues to contribute to streamflow with an increasing proportion and relatively invariant discharge (Figure 8b). Discharge from base flow is also invariant, but with a much lower discharge than talus flow. At the end of the stage, base flow from fractured bedrock dominates the streamflow.";5.3.2;Conceptual Model of Source Waters and Flow Paths, GL4 Catchment;14;GL4 catchment, Green Lakes Valley, Colorado, United States;40,049999999999997;-105,583333300000007;2,250000000000000;2;Hillslope position;12;N;N;N;N;Topography described;N;Unknown items identified;N;4,000000000000000;Soil water storage, Bedrock fracture storage, Soil saturation, Snow storage;Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Matrix, Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Surf.Snow.Stor;9,000000000000000;Overland Flow, Saturation excess flow, Snowmelt, Gaining stream, Vertical macropore flow, Infiltration, Lateral matrix flow, Overland Flow, Subsurface stormflow;Surf.Over, Surf.Over.SE, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.Soil.Macro, Surf.Inf.Inf, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix, Surf.Over, Sub.SSFlow;1,000000000000000;N/A

We found that the hillslope runoff is nonlinearly related to the catchment runoff, hillslopes are capable of transporting solutes (tracer) to the stream from upslope areas over the time scale of a storm event, event water contributions are smaller for the hillslope than the catchment, and hillslope transit times can be longer than the catchment average. The nonlinear evolving relationship between hillslope runoff and streamflow through a wet-up period was controlled by moisture thresholds and expansion of saturated areas upslope. Saturated area expansion within a thin zone above weathered bedrock was inferred through soil moisture patterns, applied tracer breakthrough, large quick flow ratios, and previous studies at this site. Event water transit time distributions and rapid breakthrough from an applied upslope tracer addition, demonstrated that contributing areas extend far upslope during events. Despite these rapid transport processes and some contribution of event water from upslope regions, we found soil water and runoff mean transit times that were greater that the time scale of storm events. Soil water mean transit times exhibited no evidence of downslope aging and were between 10 and 25 days for shallow and deep soil, respectively. On the other hand, transit times of runoff from the hillslope and the catchment during nonstorm conditions were similarly between 1 and 2 years old. Our new dynamic conceptual model is based on variable physical flow pathways and transit times through changing antecedent wetness conditionssuggesting the importance of considering length and time scales in hydrologic connectivity studies.;5;Concluding Remarks;15;WS10, H.J.

Thereafter, the onset of a snowpack reduces the downward advance of the wetting front. Unless the wetting front  reaches the deepest soil regions in the catchment during the transitional period, large-scale connectivity via lateral flow does not occur because dry pockets inhibit downslope flow along the soilbedrock interface. Streamflow during the winter originates high up in southeast-facing  unchannelled gullies from direct input of new snowmelt. This dilute water picks up some solutes as it travels down the streambed, but it remains relatively dilute. The stream loses water to the underlying soil and a saturated wedge likely develops below the stream on the underlying granite. Meanwhile, localized connectivity grows via lateral flow along the bedrock interface in the shallow soils on the hillslopes near the ridgetops and streambed. Near-stream subsurface flow is independent of activities occurring higher in the slopes. When the deep midslope soils become wetted above field capacity, whole-slope hydraulic connectivity is established and upland soils are in direct connection with the near-stream soil moisture. Previously wetted upslope regions become hydraulically connected to downslope regions, raising the head in downslope regions due to the sudden connection to the higher heads in the upland soils. This can reverse the gradient in the substream saturated wedge and turn the losing stream into a gaining stream. This allows solutes from previously disconnected sources to enter the stream, causing a step increase in electrical conductivity of the streamwater. At this point, the source of solutes has not been identified. Solutes could be derived from hillslope regions or from the near-stream saturated wedge that has accumulated solutes through the winter. Regardless, as the catchment drains, the solute source continues to deliver concentrated water to the stream because basal connectivity is sustained;N/A;CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF THE LINK BETWEEN HYDRAULIC CONNECTIVITY AND RUNOFF GENERATION;4035;Upper Dry Creek, near Boise, Idaho, United States;43,729999999999997;-116,140000000000001;0,020000000000000;2;Hillslope position;1;Season;N;N;Geological types described;Topography described;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Soil water storage, Snow storage, Perched water tables;Sub.Soil.Store, Surf.Snow.Stor, Sub.GW.Store.Perch;8,000000000000000;Losing stream, Evapotranspiration, Connectivity, Lateral matrix flow at soil-bedrock interface, Subsurface stormflow from riparian zone, Snowmelt, Vertical matrix flow, Gaining stream;Sub.GWSW.Lose, Surf.ET, Sub.GWSW.Conn, Sub.SSFlow.Matrix.Bedrk, Sub.SSFlow.Rip, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.GWSW.Gain;1,000000000000000;N/A

Despite the ground remaining frozen throughout snowmelt events, infiltration into frozen soil was the major sink of snowmelt at all three sites, and this modulated the amount of runoff available for depression-focused recharge. In addition, focused infiltration and preferential flow in frozen soil enabled meltwater to bypass a portion of the soil profile and groundwater recharge prior to ground thaw. Field data suggested that the refreezing of infiltrated meltwater during midwinter snowmelt enhanced runoff generation in frozen grassland soils, highlighting the feedback effect of previous melt events on later snowmelt event partitioning. Time delays between snow cover depletion and ponding in depressions demonstrated that shallow subsurface flow, in addition to overland flow, can be an important runoff mechanism on frozen prairie hillslopes. Both of these flow paths may facilitate preferential mass transport to groundwater.;6;Conclusion;N/A;Triple G, Spyhill, and Stauffer Catchments, Northern Prairie Region, Canada;51,422597600000003;-112,618495499999995;-9999,000000000000000;1;N;2;Season;Grassland described;N;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Snow storage, Depression storage, Refreezing;Surf.Snow.Stor, Surf.Water.Depr, Surf.Snow.Refrz;7,000000000000000;Infiltration into frozen ground, Subsurface stormflow, Overland Flow, Vertical macropore flow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Snowmelt;Surf.Frozen.Inf, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.Over, Sub.Soil.Macro, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.Soil.Drain, Surf.Snow.Melt;1,000000000000000;N/A

Rather, our combined hydrometric-isotopic-chemical tracer analysis suggests that vertical percolation of rainfall through the highly permeable volcanic soils and underlying substrate, and the progressive recharge of groundwater sources are the key hydrological processes controlling the amount, timing, and composition of subsurface storm runoff through the wetting-up cycle during the wet season. [...] [48] Isotope-inferred mean residence time estimates showed that soil water aged vertically up to 6 months through the <120 cm soil profiles across all hillslope locations. In addition, soil water showed a lagged and damped isotopic response to rainfall with increasing soil depth. These findings suggest that infiltrating rainwater flows predominantly vertically through the soil to deeper layers where contributions to groundwater recharge are likely occurring by water that bypasses the soil matrix. [...] [51] We found that at low antecedent wetness conditions, the Q/P ratio for the first storm was very small and yielded high new event water volumes produced likely by direct channel precipitation (Figure 8). Soil surface dryness could have augmented this event water contribution via seasonal hydrophobicity that may have developed following the dry season (as noted by Buttle and Turcotte [1999]). This, combined with the high rainfall intensity of this first storm (33 mm/h; maximum I60) likely contributed to produce some overland flow and/or pseudo overland flow [McDonnell et al., 1991a, 1991b], resulting in the initial high event water response. [...]
[52] As catchment wetness progressed, new event water contributions to stormflow for the two consecutive rain storms diminished rapidly and shifted toward a dominance of pre-event water, where groundwater sources had the greatest contribution to flow. We observed increases of soil moisture content levels and establishment of groundwater tables in and around the near-stream valley extending upslope within our monitored groundwater well area to lower midslope hillslope positions. Although we lack measurements of the details of subsurface flow process response internal to the catchment, we hypothesize that the shallow sources were generated from subsurface flow at the near-stream valley areas along the stream channel, where hydraulic conductivities are reduced due to decreases in soil depth (Figure 8). The deeper flow contribution seems to be provided by groundwater from within the permeable weathered volcanic breccias-saprolite substrate (Figure 8), as the isotopic composition of sample groundwater from our wells completed in the permeable weathered volcanic breccias-saprolite was effectively the same in composition as stream base flow prior to the storm (seesection 4.2.2).
[53] At high antecedent wetness, storm runoff response to the last 3 rain events produced the highest Q/Pratios and the highest pre-event water contributions, the latter of which were almost entirely dominated by groundwater sources. At this wetness stage, it is striking how the stream catchment reacted to the most intense rain event registered during the study period (Storm 5), categorized as an extreme event that occurs every 12 times during a year based on our 5-year observation period (F. Holwerda, unpublished data, 2012). Despite its short duration (<4 h), very high rain intensity (61 mm/h; maximumI60) and the high antecedent precipitation conditions (API15 = 311 mm), the storm runoff was characterized by the highest observed groundwater contribution with no evidence of shallow stormflow sources.";5;Discussion;12;A catchment in Cofre de Perote volcano, Mexico;19,488651000000001;-97,042749000000001;0,264000000000000;4;Hillslope position;3;Season and event;N;Soil types described;Geological types described;N;N;Limitations discussed;N;4,000000000000000;Soil water storage, Hydrophobicity, Groundwater storage, Water Table;Sub.Soil.Store, Surf.Inf.Soil.Hyphob, Sub.GW.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Wtable;8,000000000000000;Gaining stream, Quickflow, Infiltration, Subsurface stormflow, Overland Flow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Vertical macropore flow, Channel interception;Sub.GWSW.Gain, Chan.Flow.Quick, Surf.Inf.Inf, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.Over, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.Soil.Macro, Chan.Int;1,000000000000000;N/A

Most of the lateral subsurface flow is generated in the B horizon and travels mainly via macropores, which can result in extremely rapid water movement even in soils having very low bulk hydraulic conductivities. Throughout most of the year, the flow system has two domains a macropore domain, in which water can move relatively rapidly and in which evapotranspiration has a minor effect, and a matrix domain, in which water movement is extremely slow and transpiration has a major effect, resulting in substantial water loss and increased salt concentrations. When the soils are at or near saturation (greater than -33% volumetric water content) during snowmelt periods, a connection between the two domains is established, and concentrations of chloride, organic carbon, and other aqueous species in lateral subsurface flow rise dramatically. Under these conditions, very large volumes of lateral subsurface flow can be produced. In addition to the temporal changesin lateral subsurface flow chemistry and volumes at the ponderosapine site, old/new water percentages also change.;5;Summary and Conclusion;3496;Los Alamos National Laboratory's Environmental Research Park, United States;35,864355000000003;-106,340552000000002;0,000870000000000;1;N;1;Season with snow;Forest described;Horizons described;N;N;N;N;N;2,000000000000000;Soil saturation, Soil water storage;Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Sub.Soil.Store;5,000000000000000;Lateral matrix flow, Snowmelt, Subsurface stormflow, Evapotranspiration, Lateral macropore flow;Sub.SSFlow.Matrix, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.ET, Sub.SSFlow.Macro;1,000000000000000;N/A

According to this model, a saturated A horizon (can be localized) feeds zones of saturation that develop around Bt-horizon root macropores that are actively transporting water laterally. Eventually, given sufficient input of water, the entire soil profile can become saturated as an increasing number of root macropores begin flowing, and saturation extends outward from these macropores. Deeper horizons may also become saturated in part by downward matrix flow originating in the A horizon. The combined effects of the hydrologic properties of the soil and the distribution and density of ponderosa pine roots control the generation of lateral subsurface flow and development of saturated zones. The relatively conductive A horizon supplies water to the system of ponderosa-pine-root macropores in the Bt horizon, and the low conductivity of the Bt matrix helps focus flow along the rootmacropores while limiting downward flow into deeper soil horizons.;N/A;Summary and Conclusions;1041;Los Alamos National Laboratory's Environmental Research Park, United States;35,864355000000003;-106,340552000000002;0,000870000000000;1;N;1;N;Forest described;Horizons described;N;N;N;N;N;1,000000000000000;Soil saturation;Sub.Soil.Store.Satur;4,000000000000000;Vertical matrix flow, Lateral macropore flow at soil horizons, Snowmelt, Subsurface stormflow;Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.SSFlow.Macro.Horiz, Surf.Snow.Melt, Sub.SSFlow;1,000000000000000;N/A

Hydrologic response was variable at daily, weekly, seasonal, and multi-year time scales. Daily variability is attributable to a network of ephemerally saturated zones (macropores) at shallow (<1 m) depths [14], which appear to transmit precipitation inputs to stream channels on average within a day. However, precipitation events often last for multiple days, and soils are deep and fine-textured, so they may store considerable moisture and release it over many days, weeks, and months after a precipitation input. Multi-day and monthly scale variation in streamflow at Andrews also may be due to the accumulation and melt of a transient snowpack (at low elevations) or a seasonal snowpack (at high elevations) [15], [30] (see also Harr [16]). Seasonal variability of precipitation inputs (which does not occur at the other sites) creates pronounced seasonal variability in streamflow. Multi-year cycles in precipitation also are evident in the precipitation and streamflow record. In addition, spatial variability in hydrologic response is attributable to differences in the degree of weathering of underlying volcanic substrates, as well as to spatial variation in the types and styles of mass movements [42]. [...] The conifer forest canopy at Andrews has a strong hydrologic role at daily and seasonal timescales, and its role varies with elevation. Forests were never cleared at the Andrews basins in this study, but they were affected by fire 450 and 150 years ago [45]. The forest canopy is structurally complex, and interception and transpiration may be controlled in certain seasons by deciduous trees (e.g. vine maple, Acer circinatum) and evergreen shrubs (e.g. Arctostaphylus, Ceanothus and Rhodedendron spp.) in understory gaps [10], [13], [40]. Canopy interception may be very important in fall and spring when rainfall events are relatively short, and during winter snow events, especially at high elevations. Also, in fall and spring, conifer canopies are actively transpiring and visibly influence soil moisture and streamflow. In summer, a period of soil moisture stress at Andrews, we infer that the forest canopy may be less hydrologically important than understory vegetation, perhaps because of greater sensitivity to vapor pressure deficits or low leaf water potentials. [...] At the Andrews and Hubbard Brook, seasonal snowpacks store and release soil moisture at a time closer to the time of summer vegetation physiological activity than would be possible otherwise, especially given the limited soil moisture storage capacities at Hubbard Brook. [...] Extremely rapid hydrologic responses at Luquillo and the Andrews are suggestive of rapid shallow subsurface saturated flow in macropores. [...] Intermediate responses, i.e. baseflow contributions for up to a month on average, at Coweeta high elevation and Andrews basins suggest that water may also be stored and drained from relatively fine-textured soil matrices. The most protracted hydrologic responses, i.e. water release over many months or even years at Luquillo, low-elevation Coweeta, and Andrews basins imply that these basins have the longest flowpaths through deep, fine-textured soil or fractured bedrock.;4;Discussion;1205;"W2,8,9; H.J.

More than half of the water contributing to total interception loss is intercepted after the initial wet-up period during a storm, either to evaporate during the storm or to be held in storage for evaporation after the storm. Because leaf-area indices are relatively high in coniferous forests, the surface area of wetted foliage is large during storms, so low evaporation rates (per unit area of water surface) can lead to large volumes of water evaporated (per unit area of ground surface). Nevertheless, interception rates observed during periods of intense rainfall appear to be too high to be explained by in rain evaporation alone, even if all foliage surfaces are wetted. An additional component of in-rain interception might be accounted for by absorption by bark. Because the water storage capacity in bark is quite large in the Caspar Creek forest, the amount of rainfall absorbed by bark during most storms is expected to be roughly proportional to the amount of rain encountering the bark. The volume of water sequestered per unit time would thus increase with rainfall intensity, while the proportion of rainfall intercepted would remain relatively constant, as observed. Comparison of the timing of throughfall relative to rainfall in a nearby clearing indicates that the volume of water in storage in the canopy varies with rainfall intensity. Static storage in foliage is estimated to be about 1 mm, while the dynamic component of foliar storage can be as high as 2.4 mm. During periods of high-intensity rain, total foliar storage is therefore expected to exceed 3 mm. Water balance calculations suggest that interception loss accounted for about half the annual evapotranspiration in the North Fork Caspar Creek watershed when it supported a 120-year-old redwood forest (Table 4). About 68% of the annual evapotranspiration occurs during the OctoberApril wet season, and during this time interception accounts for about two-thirds of the loss. ;N/A;Conclusions;469;North Fork Caspar Creek watershed, California, United States;39,361269999999998;-123,735394999999997;4,700000000000000;1;N;2;Season and rainfall intensity;Forest described;N;N;N;N;N;N;0,000000000000000;N/A;N/A;5,000000000000000;Forest floor interception, Canopy Interception, Stemflow, Canopy evaporation, Throughfall;Surf.Int.Int.Forest, Surf.Int.Int.Canopy, Surf.Int.Stem, Surf.ET.Evap.Canopy, Surf.Int.Thru;1,000000000000000;N/A

In order to exceed this capacity, the antecedent conditions must be moist to allow for runoff generation in permeable soils and arroyos [Castillo et al., 2003; Howes and Abrahams, 2003]. It is evident from the rainfall and discharge observations that prior storms led to high antecedent wetness which primed the basin for a vigorous flood response. The runoff ratio computed at two locations indicates that the majority of the rainfall was absorbed in the basin, with a decreasing ratio as catchment area increased. While this has been seen in small basins of the southwestern United States [Goodrich et al., 1997], evidence has not existed at large spatial scales. In ephemeral tributaries, a propagating flood may be generated from the synchronized contributions of inner basins, but must still overcome channel losses to reach the watershed outlet. Flood characteristics, including the peak amount, wave velocity and recession rate, depend upon interactions with the channel bed and vegetated floodplain [Gorbach et al., 1996; Molnár and Ramírez, 2001]. Given these interactions, the rainfall-runoff transformation can be highly complex and nonlinear in ephemeral watersheds, in particular if landscape changes are occurring in the basin. Furthermore, surface-groundwater interactions along the internal tributary reaches and in the downstream river eventually lead to significant losses in flood volume due to focused recharge of the underlying aquifer.
[37] The third part of the conceptual model involves the interaction of a propagating flood wave with the shallow aquifer along a losing reach. The dynamics of the flood-induced changes in the water table level are highly transient but spatially coherent. Various factors control the variations in the aquifer response including the diminishing flood stage along the reach, the spatial heterogeneity in the aquifer materials and the effects of localized hydraulic gradients. The aquifer response typically diminishes along the reach and across the floodplain, but remain fairly similar over the sampled depth. On the basis of the observed three-dimensional propagation of the groundwater response from multiple wells, it is evident that kinematic propagation occurs in the saturated aquifer. As a result, wave travel velocities far exceed predictions of Darcian flow across the full floodplain width. While this has been documented in humid settings [Jung et al., 2004], evidence for this mechanism has not been observed in the semiarid southwestern United States. Furthermore, well behavior suggests that the response propagates more quickly through the deeper portions of the aquifer due to semiconfining layers which retard responses at the shallower wells.";5;Discussion;9;Río Puerco, New Mexico, United States;34,410277780000001;-106,854444400000006;16000,000000000000000;2;Hillslope position;1;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Water table rise, Soil water storage, Groundwater storage;Sub.GW.Store.Rise, Sub.Soil.Store, Sub.GW.Store;5,000000000000000;Attenuation, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Displacement of groundwater, Losing stream, Ephemeral streamflow;Chan.Atten, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.GW.Disp, Sub.GWSW.Lose, Chan.Flow.Ephem;1,000000000000000;N/A

This has been explained by a combination of frozen ground that inhibits infiltration in the winter and spring (Rey et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2015) and saturation excess overland flow as the deep snow produces snowmelt volumes above the storage capacity of the relatively shallow soils (Hill, 2017). Our observations confirm that high ¸w interpreted to mean ponding at the snowsoil interface is occurring within the snowpack that is likely producing overland/intra-snowpack flow. Importantly, our observations bring new insight to the catchment-scale distribution of these processes. Rather than elevated ¸w occurring across a widespread area, our results suggest that regions of very high ¸w values (i.e. >0.2) are highly localized at the base of a hillslope and shallow snow adjacent to deeper snowdrifts (Figure 6) yet may contribute disproportionately to catchment response (Figure 7).

As is typical of semiarid environments, runoff at our site was ephemeral and occurred only as a result of 'extreme' precipitation events (such as greater-than- average snowfall, very intense rainfall, or unusually prolonged frontal storms). The nature of these events, along with the physical properties of the soil, determined what form the runoff took. For example, lateral subsurface flow was important at our site because the combination of occasional very wet conditions and the presence of a shallow restrictive horizon allowed a shallow zone of saturation to develop, while a network of macropores facilitated this type of flow. Macropores also facilitated small amounts of flow when the soils were unsaturated. Surface runoff was also important and occurred in the form of IEOF. During the winter, this type of runoff was facilitated by frozen soils. During other periods, it was generated by intense thunderstorms or prolonged frontal storms. At the hillslope scale, frozen soil runoff was strongly affected by degree of shading and location of snowdrifts, whereas rainfall-generated runoff was affected more by extent of vegetation cover (considerably more surface runoff of this type was generated from the south hillslope, which had more exposed bare ground, than from the north hillslope);6;Conclusions;2311;Los Alamos National Laboratory's Environmental Research Park, United States;35,864355000000003;-106,340552000000002;0,000870000000000;1;N;2;Season;Forest described;N;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Perched water tables, Seasonal soil freeze/thaw, Soil stratification;Sub.GW.Store.Perch, Surf.Frozen.FrzThw, Sub.Soil.Store.Layer;8,000000000000000;Interception, Unsaturated macropore flow, Lateral macropore flow at soil horizons, Infiltration excess flow, IE flow from frozen ground, Subsurface stormflow, Snow drifting, Ephemeral streamflow;Surf.Int.Int, Sub.Soil.Macro.Unsat, Sub.SSFlow.Macro.Horiz, Surf.Over.IE, Surf.Over.IE.Frozen, Sub.SSFlow, Surf.Snow.Drift, Chan.Flow.Ephem;1,000000000000000;N/A

Intermittent streamflow generation in a merokarst headwater catchment. Environmental Science: Advances.;https://doi.org/10.1039/D2VA00191H;CC-BY;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;N/A;N/A;N/A;"We interpret that groundwater discharge dominates headwater streamflow generation in the merokarst of N04D, during both high and low flow conditions (Fig. 8). Contributions from surface runoff are only important during some storms, and contributions from soil water are volumetrically insignificant across the entire wet season. These behaviors are in contrast to the widespread shallow-and-deep hypothesis of streamflow generation, which states that contributions to streamflow from shallow units (i.e. surface runoff and soil water) become increasingly more important relative to deep units (i.e. groundwater) under wet conditions. While studies conducted at non-karstic catchments of similar size to N04D generally support the shallow-and-deep hypothesis, we hold that the karstic properties of N04D prevent the development of such a regime. Thin soils place an upper limit on the significance of shallow flow paths, while soil macropores and bedrock fractures rapidly route water to limestone aquifers ensuring that deep flow paths remain dominant even during very wet conditions. Given that groundwater flow paths are critical in sustaining streamflow, our finding that there are groundwater storage thresholds which govern subsurface connections to the stream then implies that these thresholds are major controllers on stream intermittency. Significant, sustained streamflow can only occur when enough precipitation has fallen in a short enough amount of time to surpass the groundwater storage thresholds.
The thinly bedded nature of the limestones at N04D means that its hydrological behavior also deviates from what is typically seen in massive karst systems. Confining mudstone layers largely restrict vertical movement of water between limestones and the unique depositional history of each individual limestone bed means that each one might possess unique hydrogeological properties. Whether caused by differences in hydraulic conductivity or simple stratigraphic position, our results show that each of our studied limestone aquifers, which are vertically separated by only a couple of meters from one another, respond to recharge and interact with the stream in different ways (Fig. 4). This heterogeneity expands the capacity of the subsurface to act as a hydrological buffer, in that each limestone unit releases recharge into the stream at a different rate to effectively extend the amount of time that the stream can flow. Consistent with this observation, streams across the Flint Hills region of Kansas have greater proportions of baseflow in total streamflow than streams in adjacent, non-merokarstic regions,62 suggesting that the merokarst bedrock does improve hydrological buffering.";4.6;Implications;128;Watershed N04D, Konza Prairie LTER, Kansas, United States;39,087397000000003;-96,584597000000002;1,200000000000000;1;N;1;N;N;N;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;2,000000000000000;Multiple storage reservoirs producing discharge, Groundwater storage;Sub.GW.Store.Mult, Sub.GW.Store;7,000000000000000;Vertical macropore flow, Intermittent streamflow, Pistonflow, Overland Flow, Connectivity, Groundwater flow, Gaining stream;Sub.Soil.Macro, Chan.Flow.Interm, Sub.GW.Disp.Piston, Surf.Over, Sub.GWSW.Conn, Sub.GW.Flow, Sub.GWSW.Gain;1,000000000000000;N/A

These findings are contrary to the prevailing hypothesis that drainage areas continue to receive water subsidies and are more mesic than the uplands (Archer 1995, Wu and Archer 2005, Parker et al 2010). During the 20 months of our study, overland flow was nonexistent despite some relatively large rainfall events. Our soil moisture measurements also provide strong evidence that there is little if any redistribution of water from the uplands to the lower-lying drainage-woodlands. If such redistribution were occurring, there would be dramatic differences in soil moisture between the two landforms. For example, in banded vegetation drylands of Australia, soil moisture levels were 5 times higher in downslope tree groves than in adjacent upland intercanopy areas (Ludwig et al 2005). In contrast, our measurements showed insignificant differences in soil moisture. Further, our comparison of soil infiltrability and field saturated hydraulic conductivity between our ungrazed study site and the nearby grazed site demonstrates that even moderate grazing pressure dramatically diminished soil infiltrability and likely led to much higher surface runoff. Weltz and Blackburn (1995) monitored runoff from large (5 m × 7 m) plots over a 20-month period at our study site and found that runoff was still being generated from the upland areas 40 years ago (soon after the removal of livestock). They found that for rainfall events larger than 100 mm, runoff could be as high as 8% of rainfall. It is quite likely that 150 years ago, when the site was subjected to severe overgrazing, runoff from the uplands into the drainage areas was much higher.

The prevailing evidence suggests that relaxation of grazing along with an increase in woody plants has greatly reduced hydrologic connectivity between the uplands and the drainage areaswhich could explain the complete cessation of subsidy inputs to the drainage-woodlands. We postulate that at our site, the drainage areas were more mesic under the overgrazed conditions of the past, owing to a more ecohydrologically connected state. While fire suppression and grazing may have been the primary triggers for recruitment and expansion of woody plants, it is likely that the greater water availability in the drainage-woodlands made this location more favorable for WPE. This proposition is supported by the higher SOC accumulation and the greater mean age of stands in the drainage-woodlands, noted by Boutton et al (1998). In other words, the hydrological state of the landscape must have been a crucial factor in determining the patterns of recruitment in the earlier stages of WPE.";N/A;The combination of rangeland recovery and WPE alters ecohydrological connectivity;8;La Copita Research Area, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, United States;27,658614151346100;-98,209360451995295;11,000000000000000;2;Land use / Land cover;1;N;Vegetation described;N;N;N;N;N;N;3,000000000000000;Compaction, Soil water storage, Compaction;Surf.Snow.Age.Compac, Sub.Soil.Store, Surf.Inf.Soil.Compac;1,000000000000000;Overland Flow;Surf.Over;1,000000000000000;N/A

The macropore network takes several years to develop after introduction of the grass, as indicated by the delayed hydrological response of the wetlands to the cultivated-to-grass conversion. Increased dryness of the soil beneath the grass is also a contributing factor, but its contribution is relatively minor.

Conceptually, we can hypothesize a mound of water fluctuating within the highly permeable sub-surface of this resurgent dome (Figure 8). The beginning of observations used in this study coincides with the ending of the 2006 North American Monsoon season. In the southwestern United States this monsoon season occurring in late summer 2006 was one of the wettest on record. This antecedent condition of our observations brings the water table in the Redondo Peak very close to the soil surface across all landscape positions (even at the highest elevations). As a result, more continuous segments of the streams monitored in this study are flowing with water above the soil surface. This is represented by the high percentage of wet lengths predicted during late November 2006 (Figure 5). Conceptually, the presence of a water table near the soil surface sustains streamflow (Figure 8(a)). 
Moving forward into the winter season, the Redondo Peak experiences a distinct snow accumulation period. As snow accumulates, the monitored streams in this study are exposed to less light until they reach some (more or less) steady value of exposure (Figure 6). As snow is accumulating over the winter period, there is limited to no water input to the water table in the Redondo Peak. This leads to more discontinuity in sections of the monitored streams that are flowing at the soil surface. The high percentage of wet streams begins to decrease for the higher elevation streams and is reflected well in the streams draining through the north to southeast aspects (Streams 1 through 5 in Figure 5). The predicted wetness of the lower elevation streams draining through the south and west of the Redondo Peak not only shows relatively high wetness during this period but also exhibits high variability in wetness. This is likely a combination of rain mixed with snow falling at lower elevations and quick melting occurring on southern and western exposures. 
The snowmelt season occurs at the Redondo Peak for this study from mid-March to mid-April 2007 (Figures 3 and 7(b)). Snowmelt is, of course, variable in space and time. Elevation appears to exhibit a primary control over the timing of melt (Figure 7(b)) due to temperature gradients rising with elevation. In addition, there is a secondary control of aspect on snowmelt as it occurs earlier and more readily on southern and western aspects of the Redondo Peak (Figures 3 and 6). Coincident to this snowmelt period over the entire Redondo Peak, water infiltrates and raises the water table closer to the soil surface (Figure 8(c)). There is an increase in the percentage of monitored stream lengths predicted as wet (Figure 5). This is exemplified in the response of the eastern aspect stream (Stream 3 in Figure 5), but seen in all the streams. Variations in the timing of snowmelt leads to variations in timing of this peak-predicted wetness for each stream. 
After all the snow on the Redondo Peak has melted, the predicted wetness of each stream becomes highly variable through the summer period. Summer is typified by sparse rainfall and rapid growth in vegetation. Thus, evapotranspiration and uptake associated with plant growth tend to draw down the water table in the Redondo Peak. This is similar to the results of Molotch et al. (this issue) and Vivoni et al. (this issue), which indicate that vegetation plays a role in determining the spatial and temporal patterns in soil moisture across the landscape. This is counteracted by sporadic recharge from rainfall over the summer season. Since summer storms are localized in the VCNP, the relation between landscape wetness and streamflow is relatively weaker during the monsoon as compared to the winter and spring seasons (Vivoni et al., this issue). In our conceptual model, this period is best represented by a highly variable position of the water table (Figure 8(d)). This fluctuation in the percentage length of streams flowing in headwater positions demonstrates the tight coupling between streams (or surface water) and the landscape (or groundwater) in this system. Towards the end of the summer (and, coincidently, the end of the period of observation), we begin to see a general trend of increase in the percentage length of stream predicted as wet (Figure 5). This corresponds, again, to the late summer North American Monsoon as we cycle through the year. In addition, the length of days begins to shorten, leading to decreased plant activity across the Redondo Peak and lower evapotranspiration rates. 
Obviously, this simplistic conceptual model merely provides a first-cut of the myriad of hydrologic processes occurring within the Redondo Peak. For example, Stream 8, a mid-elevation stream draining through a westnorthwestern aspect, shows limited or no response in predicted wetness throughout the sampling period. This could indicate that this stream is being fed by deeper groundwater sources than those represented in our conceptual model (e.g. geothermal upwelling or springs). Such inference could be clarified using the composition of chemical components (i.e. stable water isotopes) present in this stream to determine the relative age of the water. That is, is the water sampled in Stream 8 more similar to rainfall or shallow ground water or more similar to water sampled from deep groundwater wells with respect to chemical composition? This indicates a need for year-round sampling to determine the sources and ecohydrological controls on the water in streams draining the Redondo Peak.

In winter, frontal storms originating in the northern Pacific bring low intensity rainfall that may last for several days but generally results in little runoff. In summer, monsoonal airflow from the Gulf of Mexico provides the moisture input for convective thunderstorms. These thunderstorms are characterized by high rainfall rates, short durations, and small areal extents, and are responsible for about 60% of the annual rainfall and virtually all of the runoff.
The main runoff process on semiarid hillslopes, such as those found in the Jornada Basin, is Horton overland flow (Horton, 1933). This type of overland flow occurs when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration rate. The infiltration excess is initially stored in small surface depressions, but once these depressions are filled, it begins to flow downhill. Overland flow is hydraulically very complex. Flow depths and velocities are highly variable over space due to microtopography (Dunne et al., 1991) and the presence of stones and vegetation Emmett, 1970, Emmett, 1978. Over small areas, overland flow may be laminar, turbulent, transitional, or may consist of patches of any of these three flow states (Abrahams et al., 1990).
A principal consequence of the transition from grassland to shrubland is a significant change in the nature of overland flow. On grassland hillslopes, overland flow is dispersed; resistance to flow is high; and flow velocities are low (Abrahams et al., 1994). On shrubland hillslopes, overland flow tends to be more concentrated in character. Most shrubs reside on microtopographic mounds a few centimeters high, which cause overland flow in the bare intershrub areas to concentrate in flow paths that diverge and converge around the shrubs in a complex reticular pattern. These flow concentrations have greater flow velocities and are more erosive than comparable discharges on grassland hillslopes.
The development of shrub mounds is attributed to a number of abiotic and biotic processes (Schlesinger and Pilmanis, 1998). Abiotic processes include the deposition of fine clastic material by wind and differential rainsplash. Differential rainsplash Carson and Kirkby, 1972, Parsons et al., 1992 refers to the tendency for more sediment to be splashed from intershrub to shrub areas than in the reverse direction because raindrop energy is dissipated by shrub canopies. In shrubland areas that were formerly grassland, the surface (A-) horizon of the grassland soil has been eroded in the intershrub areas, but remnants persist under the larger shrubs. Thus, the mounds under these shrubs are partly erosional and partly depositional Parsons et al., 1992, Abrahams et al., 1995. Biotic processes include uptake and subsequent recycling of nutrients through the deposition of litter in the area beneath the shrub, digging by rodents (which enhances infiltration) and the funneling of intercepted rainfall to the base of the shrub by stemflow. Since these processes tend to concentrate water and nutrients beneath the shrub canopies, the shrub mounds tend to correspond to islands of fertility (Schlesinger et al., 1990) or resource islands (Reynolds et al., 1999).
Studies concerned with the supply of water to shrubs tend to focus on the role of interception and stemflow (e.g., Navar and Bryan, 1990, Martinez-Meza and Whitford, 1996, Abrahams et al., manuscript in preparation). Furthermore, plant growth models developed by Reynolds et al. (1997) to simulate the evolution of shrubland ecosytems are based on the assumption that all of the water reaching a shrub originates as rain falling directly onto the shrub. The lateral redistribution of water by overland flow from areas of runoff to areas of runon is widely recognized as being critical to plant production of desert ecosystems Schlesinger and Jones, 1984, Noy-Meir, 1985.

This results in a snowmelt-dominated hydrograph with an annual average streamflow of 6.5 m3/s at the transition between the mountain and valley portions of the watershed. Peak flows occur in the spring with low flows spanning summer through winter.

The headwaters are located on the Utah-Idaho border with little development in the upper, mountainous portion of the watershed. Land cover within the upper portion of the watershed is primarily characterized by forest and rangeland. The bedrock geology comprises primarily limestone and dolomite formations with karst topography marked with sinkholes and fractures that feed underground drainage systems that are intercepted by interbedded siliciclastic units (Bahr, 2016; Dover, 1995; Spangler, 2001). Three major karst springs (Ricks, Wood Camp Hollow, and DeWitt Springs) contribute significant flow directly to the Logan River throughout most of the year. Additional inflow to the river and its tributaries originates from numerous springs (both karst and non-karst) which may or may not flow year-round. DeWitt Springs serve as the primary drinking water source for nearby Logan City. Three perennial tributaries (Beaver Creek, Temple Fork Creek, and Right Hand Fork Creek) join the Logan River along with other intermittent tributaries in the upper portion of the watershed.

In contrast, the lower portion of the watershed is characterized by considerable anthropogenic influences. Before exiting Logan Canyon, a significant fraction of the Logan River is diverted into the Highline Canal during the MayOctober irrigation season. Upon entering the valley, the river cuts through layers of unconsolidated gravel, sand, silt, and clay deposits from the Provo, Alpine, and Bonneville stages of ancient Lake Bonneville (Dover, 1995). It flows on a bed of main-stream alluvium through the urban areas of Logan City, then westward through predominantly agricultural areas before merging with Cutler Reservoir. Along this path, two additional diversions (Crockett Canal and Young Ward Canal) again remove large fractions of the streamflow to supply Logan and surrounding communities with both urban and agricultural irrigation water. Two similarly anthropogenically influenced tributaries, Spring Creek and the Blacksmith Fork River, converge with the Logan River near the transition between the dominantly urban and dominantly agricultural portion of the watershed. The lowest flows occur during the summer irrigation period given the frequent and large diversions from the Logan River and its tributaries in the valley. In dry years, all remaining water is removed at the most downstream diversion, leaving a dry channel. However, within the lower portion of the watershed, there are also many unknown and ungaged inflows that help maintain some amount of flow in the Logan River during these periods.";2;LOGAN RIVER WATERSHED DESCRIPTION;1;Logan River watershed, Utah, United States;41,743549999999999;-111,783980600000007;1372,000000000000000;2;Topography;1;N;Vegetation types described;N;Geological types described;N;N;N;N;1,000000000000000;Snow storage;Surf.Snow.Stor;6,000000000000000;Perennial flow, Snowmelt, Intermittent streamflow, Channel flow, Pistonflow, Springflow;Chan.Flow.Peren, Surf.Snow.Melt, Chan.Flow.Interm, Chan.Flow, Sub.GW.Disp.Piston, Sub.GW.Ret.Spr;1,000000000000000;N/A

Since 1981, it has been the site of a long-term ecological monitoring and research program. The watershed ranges in elevation from 3110 m at the outlet of the lowest lake, The Loch, to 4010 m at the Continental Divide. More than 80% of the basin surface consists of bedrock outcrop and active talus slopes. Bedrock consists primarily of Precambrian-aged granitic gneiss and schist (Cole, 1977; Mast, 1989). Several permanent snowfields and an active rock glacier, remnants of neoglacial activity, occupy about 1% of the watershed. In areas of relatively gentle slope, the valley floor is covered with glacial till of Pinedale age (Mast, 1989). Forest soils have developed on the moraine veneer below 3300 m elevation, covering about 5% of the area of the catchment. Complete profile descriptions and chemical analyses can be found in Walthall (1985). Soil pH (1:1 paste) ranges between 3.7 and 4.8. Cation exchange capacity of these soils ranges from 50 to 100 ceq kg -l, but base saturations are quite low, with a mean of 23% in the organic surface layers and decreasing to below 10% in the deeper horizons. The exchange complex is dominated by Ca (Walthall, 1985; Baron and Walthall, 1985). Soil development is very heterogeneous, varying in depth from 1 to 50 cm. These soils support a mature forest of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanii) and subalpine fir (Abies Iasiocarpa), which covers about 6% of the total land area (Arthur, 1990). Alluvial and bog soils occupy only about 1% of the watershed, but have a disproportionate influence on surface water chemistry due to their position adjacent to stream channels. These highly organic soils are characterized by base saturations of less than 13% (Walthall, 1985). Accumulation of snowpack in LVWS begins in November of each year, and the melt begins in mid- to late-April. More than 75% of the annual water input to the basin is in the form of snow. Midwinter melting events are extremely rare, and snowpack temperatures remain below 0 °C above the 'depth hoar' zone from about November through late March. Peak runoff occurs late May to early June, with 40 to 50% of annual runoff occurring by July 1 (Figure 2). Meltwater from the permanent snowfields contributes to stream discharge through August, and baseflow is maintained by groundwater seepage until early winter. From December through February there is no baseflow. The volume of The Loch is about 60 000 m 3, but during winter more than half of the total water volume of the lake freezes. The remaining water is confined to a narrow channel between the inlet and outlet, so at the beginning of snowmelt the lake is more appropriately treated as part of Icy Brook. Baron and Bricker (1987) documented major increases in solute concentrations under winter ice cover; these were attributed to the exclusion of dissolved ions from lake ice. [&] Flowing water was first observed in 1987 at the Loch Outlet on March 13, following a period of unseasonably warm temperatures. Stream water was sampled from a hole excavated through the snowpack during March and part of April, but stream discharge remained too low to measure until April 22 (Figure 4a). [&] Wind redistribution of the snow during the winter led to large differences in the depth of the snowpack, and differences in slope, aspect, and vegetative cover (shading) are likely to cause some areas to begin melting much earlier than other areas. The high-concentration early meltwater must have been flowing from some areas of the watershed even as later, more dilute water was being contributed from other areas. This spatial heterogeneity of meltwater production resulted in less acidic inputs to surface waters than would be expected if the entire snowpack ripened and released meltwater at the same time. [&] Declining total ionic strength through the melt period in both years (Figure 6) further support the hypothesis that soil solution was flushed rapidly by infiltration of meltwater. A similar pattern was reported by Johanessen et al. (1980). These authors categorized the runoff into three phases: early piston flow, peak concentrations from snowpack solute release, and dilution. [&] The relatively strong influence of forest soil drainage on stream composition at the beginning of the melt season is somewhat surprising given the small areal soil coverage of the watershed. Mast et al. (1990) have shown that on an annual basis, weathering of primary minerals in the bedrock of LVWS can explain nearly all of the flux of ions from the basin. We hypothesize that snowpack in the lowest (forested) parts of the watershed melts earliest, and that asynchronous melting causes surface waters to exhibit the characteristics of a forested catchment with welldeveloped soils in the early spring. Later in the season meltwater inputs from higher areas of the basin dominate, and solute chemistry reflects the predominantly alpine character of the watershed. By late spring the soil drainage component is difficult to detect.
